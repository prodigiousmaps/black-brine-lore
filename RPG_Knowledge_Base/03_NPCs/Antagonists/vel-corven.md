# Appearance 
  Vel is a vision of elegance and mystery. Slender and tall, they glide
  rather than walk, draped in flowing silks and adorned in moonstone jewelry. Their
  mask—different every night—hides all but their piercing eyes, which shimmer like
  still water under starlight. Their scent, a heady blend of rare spices and midnight
  blooms, clings to every room they leave.

# Personality 
  Vel speaks in riddles and rhymes, weaving gossip with prophecy. They
  are seductively persuasive, rarely raise their voice, and command a room with poise
  alone. Devoted to beauty, sensation, and the subtle accumulation of power, Vel exudes
  patience, menace, and allure in equal measure. They reward loyalty with luxury—and
  betrayal with elegant ruin.

# Abilities
- Enchanting Presence: Disadvantage on Insight checks to detect deception
- Fey Charm (1/day): Can charm a humanoid with a whispered phrase and gaze
- Mask of Many Faces: Always appears calm, alluring, and unreadable
- Whispers of the Velvet Nest: Commands a network of spies, lovers, and blackmailers

# Backstory
  No one knows where Vel came from. Some say they arrived from the feywild
  during a blood moon; others whisper they were once a noble cast out for scandal.
  What is known: they built the Twilight Society from whispered promises and forbidden
  pleasures, binding nobles and misfits alike in a web of secrets. They may serve
  Sharess—or something far older, far stranger.

- Preserve and expand the influence of the Twilight Society

- Certain members of the Lending House and City Hull
- A masked fey emissary known only as "The Lanternless"
