# Arlo "The Noose" Vex

[[IMG_2193]]

**Smuggler King of Salt Crown | The Gentleman Executioner | Black Brine’s Silent Hangman**

---

**No one escapes The Noose.** Not the debtors who beg for time, not the rivals who overstep, not the fools who think they can cheat him. **Arlo Vex tightens his grip slowly, deliberately—until there’s no escape.**

A **study in contrasts**, Arlo Vex is both **a refined businessman and a ruthless enforcer**. He wears **tailored suits, silk cravats, and gold cufflinks**, his presence more akin to a noble than a crime lord. But those who mistake him for **just another merchant of vice** soon learn the truth—he fights with **bare fists and a butcher’s cleaver**, and he has **never lost a fight he intended to win**. He doesn’t yell, doesn’t gloat—he simply **breaks, cuts, and strangles** until the matter is settled.

Arlo rules **Salt Crown’s black market** from **The Gentle Rest**, an upscale inn that serves as both a sanctuary and a trap. **Beneath its polished floors lies a labyrinth of smuggling tunnels, hidden vaults, and secret passageways**, making him nearly untouchable. His enforcers—**the Coilmen**—enforce his will, but when a lesson must be taught personally, **Arlo Vex handles it himself.**

### **The Key to Sedna’s Vault**

Among his many treasures, Arlo possesses **a relic the priests of Sedna desperately want—the key to the vault beneath their temple.** Some say he **won it from a doomed pirate in a rigged card game**, others whisper that he **pried it from a dead man’s hands**. Whatever the truth, he **doesn’t fear the priests and has no intention of handing it over**. The key is **just another asset**—one he will **sell, trade, or use when the moment suits him.**

### **A Debt to The Noose**

- **He never forgets a name. Never forgets a debt.** He keeps a **meticulous ledger**, written in ink, blood, and broken bones.

- **His influence spreads slowly, silently, like a noose tightening around the throat of Salt Crown itself.**

- **If he rolls up his sleeves, the fight is already over. If he loosens his cravat, the execution is next.**

### **Legends & Whispers**

- *"You don’t see The Noose tighten. Not until you’re gasping for breath."*

- *"He doesn’t run Salt Crown. He owns it. Like a man owns a gallows."*

- *"Arlo Vex is patient. He lets you squirm. Lets you think you’ve got a chance. Then he pulls tight."*

- *"They say The Noose keeps trophies. Gloves made of the skin of the men who tried to kill him."*

### **The Noose’s Reach**

- **Runs Salt Crown’s smuggling empire**, controlling contraband, assassins-for-hire, and black-market trading.

- **Keeps the city’s corrupt officials in his pocket**, ensuring that even the governor looks the other way.

- **Has a reputation for handling his own business**—when he comes for you, it’s **not just a message, it’s the end.**

- **The priests of Sedna want him dead, but they can’t touch him. Not without paying in blood.**
