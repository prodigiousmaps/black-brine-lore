# Description
Once a renowned noble chef of the Inner Seas, Gellard DuMarque fled scandal and debt to reinvent himself in Black Brine. His cuisine is extravagant, spiced with rare imports, and often laced with risky alchemy. Rupert tolerates his flair because it keeps both guests and students guessing.

# Personality
- Dramatic, flamboyant, and prone to reciting menus as poetry.  
- Treats meals as both art and theater.  
- Loyal to Rupert but keeps his own secrets.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Still in contact with noble houses who believe him dead.  
- Occasionally poisons dishes—not lethally—to test fortitude.
