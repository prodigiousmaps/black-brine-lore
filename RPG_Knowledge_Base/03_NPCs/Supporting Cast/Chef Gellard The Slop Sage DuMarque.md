[couchwarrior_Dungeons_and_Dragons_fantasy_portrait_broad-should_2f5f3e5b-a762-4185-b731-61d42a51b092](https://app.capacities.io/31f71015-b54c-41a2-8667-93c80b54b876/8934ba3b-66ef-4287-a047-1fd04d5a2f9f)

- **Race**: Dwarf

- **Age**: 130

- **Appearance**: A **broad-shouldered dwarven woman** with **dark, curly hair pinned messily under a bandana**, a **weathered face**, and **ink-stained fingers** from writing down experimental recipes.

- **Personality**:

    - **Gruff, no-nonsense, and fiercely proud** of her craft.

    - Hates **picky eaters, dietary restrictions, and anyone who messes with her kitchen** (including Rupert).

    - **Curses in four languages** but has a heart of gold.

    - Believes **a good meal can solve most problems**, and for everything else, there’s her **cleaver.**

- **Background & Skills**:

    - Once **cooked for a pirate crew**, learning **seafood dishes and survival cooking** in the worst conditions.

    - Specializes in **alchemy-infused meals**, brewing **stews that boost magic, teas that cure exhaustion, and pastries that might explode** if prepared incorrectly.

    - Wields a **cleaver enchanted to “cut the truth” from things**—if she carves into a lie, the meat turns to ash.

    - Keeps **a massive iron cauldron** in the kitchen that she calls **"Old Thunder"**, which **emits ominous bubbling noises even when empty**.
