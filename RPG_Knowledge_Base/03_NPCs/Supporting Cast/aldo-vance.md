# Description
Aldo Vance is a shrewd businessman and consummate manipulator, hiding his ruthlessness behind polished manners. He dresses in fine silks, wears gold rings from every profitable deal, and never enters a room without calculating the advantage. Aldo treats the Golden Gull as both a tavern and a political stage where debts, favors, and secrets are traded more freely than rum.

# Personality
- Ambitious, meticulous, and always outwardly polite.  
- Keeps a ledger of every debt owed to him.  
- Views friendships as investments, loyalty as leverage.  
- Disdains the chaos of the Powder Keg, calling Blastcap a brute.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Uses assassins to eliminate rivals quietly.  
- Holds compromising ledgers on multiple captains.  
- Once arranged the “Lost Shipment Incident” to frame Blastcap.
