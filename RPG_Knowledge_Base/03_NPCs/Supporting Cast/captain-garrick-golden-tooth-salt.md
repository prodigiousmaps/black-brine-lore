## **Merchant-Lord of The Gilded Rats**

- **Ships:** 5 well-armed merchant galleons

- **Crew:** **Wealthy traders, spies, and thieves**

- **Flag:** **Gold with a rat holding a dagger**

- **Style:** **Bribery over battles, deception over strength**

- **Reputation:** **The most hated captain in Black Brine—because he always profits**

- **Notoriety:** **His fleet never fires a shot, yet still wins every fight**

- **Customs & Norms:**

    - **The Stolen Jewel** – Each crew member must own **one piece of noble jewelry**, proving they have stolen from the rich.

    - **Deals Over Death** – Any battle that can be **won with gold instead of blood** must be.

    - **The Gold Coin Gambit** – All major disputes are settled with a **single coin toss**—the loser pays, no exceptions.
