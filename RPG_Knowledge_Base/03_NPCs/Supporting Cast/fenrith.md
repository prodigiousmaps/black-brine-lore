### **Overview**

Fenrith is a name whispered **in fear and respect** across the lawless corners of Faerûn. A **gunfighter without equal**, he sees the world through the **cold calculation of a predator**, lining up every shot with the precision of a serpent striking its prey.

The PCs may seek him out **to learn the art of firearms**, but Fenrith does not **teach the weak**. He will train **only those he deems worthy**, and failure **has consequences.**

---

### **Appearance**

Fenrith's **golden, scaly skin** shimmers under torchlight, his **slitted pupils burning like molten brass**. He is wrapped in **dark leather, layered for flexibility**, with a **gun belt strapped across his chest** and a long, blackened rifle slung over his back.

A **massive serpent**—its scales a match for his own—coils around his shoulders like a living scarf, its forked tongue flicking at the air, tasting the tension in the room. Fenrith rarely smiles, and when he does, it is the **hungry grin of something that never prays—only preys.**

---

### **Personality & Behavior**

- **A Man of Precision** – Every movement, every breath, every shot is **measured and controlled**.

- **No Room for Mercy** – Hesitation **gets you killed**. Fenrith expects **absolute discipline** in those he trains.

- **Cold but Calculated** – He does not care for **good or evil**—only **the rules of survival** and the art of **the perfect kill.**

- **Mistrusts Magic** – "Steel and powder don’t betray. Magic does." He despises **reliance on spellcraft**, preferring skill and technology.

- **Cunning, Not Reckless** – He will not enter **a battle he has not already won in his mind.**

---

### **Role in the Campaign**

- **Firearms Trainer** – Fenrith will train the PCs **only after they pass a brutal test of accuracy and discipline**.

- **Tactical Advisor** – He can teach them **ambush tactics, counter-sniping, and how to outthink enemies.**

- **Contract Killer** – For the right price, Fenrith will take a **life at range**, no questions asked.

- **Enemy of Magic-Wielders** – He has a **deep hatred for magic-users**, especially those who **trust in fate over skill.**

- **Keeper of a Hidden Armory** – If the PCs need **advanced firearms, special ammunition, or experimental weaponry**, Fenrith is their only option.

### **Fenrith’s Laws of the Gun**

1. **One shot. One kill. Anything else is failure.**

2. **If they see you coming, you’ve already lost.**

3. **The man who talks first is the first to die.**

4. **If you run out of bullets, use your blade. If your blade fails, use your hands. If your hands fail, you were never worth training.**

5. **Magic is a crutch. A gun is certainty.**
