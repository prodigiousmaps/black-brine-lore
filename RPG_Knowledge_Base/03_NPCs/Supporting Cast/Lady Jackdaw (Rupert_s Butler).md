[couchwarrior_A_diminutive_wiry_Kenku_with_sleek_black_feathers__5d66bfbc-c6d7-416b-a47c-96feb5c6b6dc](https://app.capacities.io/31f71015-b54c-41a2-8667-93c80b54b876/17107d7f-aae5-44f8-8183-6163828cec45)

### **Lady Jackdaw – Rupert Richthorn’s Butler**

**Race:** Kenku

**Class:** Rogue (Mastermind) / Bard (College of Whispers)

**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral

**Age:** Unknown (Appears Middle-Aged)

**Languages:** Common, Thieves' Cant, Auran, and an uncanny ability to mimic voices perfectly

---

### **Overview**

Lady Jackdaw is Rupert Richthorn’s personal butler, confidante, and, when necessary, shadowy enforcer. Unlike most Kenku, who scurry in the gutters of society, she carries herself with an air of poise and refinement, as if she were born to serve nobility. It is said that she once served in the courts of Amn, handling matters of "delicate discretion," before she came into Rupert’s employ. Whether she left that life by choice or necessity remains unclear, but her loyalty to Rupert is unwavering.

Jackdaw is known for her **flawless etiquette**, impeccable timing, and **eerily precise mimicry**, which she uses both as a tool of efficiency and subtle intimidation. She can replicate **any voice she has ever heard**, which makes her invaluable in espionage and subterfuge. She rarely speaks in her own voice—if she even has one—but instead selects from an **arsenal of borrowed tones**, tailoring them to the situation at hand.

---

### **Appearance & Demeanor**

Lady Jackdaw is a sleek, dark-feathered Kenku, her plumage kept immaculately clean, often adorned with subtle silver or violet accessories. She wears a finely tailored **black and silver coat**, embroidered with subtle arcane sigils that Rupert has personally woven into the fabric, reinforcing her protection. **A silver pocket watch** dangles from her belt—a relic of a past life, rumored to be an object of sentimental or magical significance.

Her presence is **calm, methodical, and unsettlingly observant**. She has an unnerving habit of appearing precisely when needed, whether to refill a glass, produce a needed document, or deliver ominous words in the exact voice of someone who said them hours—or years—ago.

### **Skills & Abilities**

- **Perfect Mimicry** – Can flawlessly reproduce any voice she has heard, making her an expert in deception, infiltration, and psychological manipulation.

- **Master of Stealth & Subterfuge** – Despite her refined demeanor, Jackdaw is an exceptional rogue, skilled in silent movement, sleight of hand, and subtle persuasion.

- **Arcane Insight** – Though she is no wizard, she has picked up **enough magical knowledge from Rupert** to recognize spells, enchantments, and magical threats.

- **Immaculate Timing** – She always knows **exactly when to enter a room** to deliver news, interrupt a conversation, or diffuse a tense moment.

### **Role in Rupert’s Household**

Lady Jackdaw’s duties extend beyond typical butlery; she manages Rupert’s **schedules, security, and clandestine affairs**. She is as much **a spymaster as she is a servant**, coordinating with informants, keeping track of Rupert’s numerous debts and favors, and ensuring that those who trespass against him **are swiftly handled**—sometimes before Rupert even needs to know about it.

While she maintains the decorum of a dutiful butler, those who **cross her, disrespect Rupert, or breach the sanctity of his home** often find that Jackdaw’s claws extend beyond serving platters and paperwork.

### **Rumors & Secrets**

- **The Silver Pocket Watch** – Some say it belonged to a former master. Others whisper that it is an artifact from a lost time of Kenku history. No one knows why she keeps it so close.

- **The Court of Amn** – If she once served in Amn’s aristocratic circles, what forced her departure? Did she betray someone—or was she betrayed?

- **The Shadow Network** – Jackdaw’s contacts extend beyond Rupert’s circle. Some believe she runs a **silent network of spies and informants**, her own insurance policy.

- **A Kenku’s True Voice?** – Some speculate that Lady Jackdaw still **remembers her original voice**—but refuses to use it, keeping it as the one secret even Rupert does not know.

### **Quotes**

🕊️ *“Apologies, I could not help but overhear.”* (In the voice of the person she just overheard.)

🕊️ *“Master Richthorn is indisposed. You may leave… or I can escort you out.”* (In a perfectly calm, neutral tone.)

🕊️ *“Your words were most unwise. Would you like to hear them again?”* (Repeats their own threat back at them, word for word.)

🕊️ *“You are, of course, welcome to test my patience. But be warned—my patience is not mine alone.”*
