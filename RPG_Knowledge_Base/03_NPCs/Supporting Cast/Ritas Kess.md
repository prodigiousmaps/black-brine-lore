# Rita Kess

## Appearance
Broad-shouldered and iron-eyed, Rita wears soot like a second skin. Her hair, once red, is now streaked with gray and always tied back under a leather bandana. Thick arms, burn-scarred hands, and an ever-present blacksmith’s apron mark her trade. Her boots are steel-toed and her voice has the rumble of hammer on anvil.

## Personality
Blunt, disciplined, and proud. Rita values precision over praise and effort over excuses. She has little patience for fools and less for flattery. Beneath the tough exterior lies a quiet care for her apprentices and a deep love for her work. She believes every blade tells a story, and poorly made ones are lies.

## Backstory
Rita fought in her youth—ships, raids, skirmishes across the southern coasts. But when her captain fell and her crew scattered, she turned her fury inward and hammered it into steel. Settling in Black Brine, she built her forge brick by brick and earned her reputation strike by strike. The council offered her a flag once. She turned it down. "Ships break. Steel endures."

## Skills & Traits
- **Master Weaponsmith** – can craft magical arms and armor with rare materials and rituals
- **Mentor’s Eye** – gains advantage when instructing or evaluating others in craftwork
- **Veteran’s Reflexes** – rarely surprised, always ready with a hammer or a glare

## Beliefs & Values
- **Steel is truth. It bends or breaks, but it never lies.**
- Follows **Gond**, not as a worshiper but as a fellow crafter—respect, not reverence.
- Holds a quiet disdain for decorative or impractical weapons.

## Relationships
- Respected by Gun Deck Rosy and other captains for her work, but avoids politics.
- Protective of her four journeymen, treats them like rough-cut family.
- Has an ongoing rivalry with Darnell Gunderson (gunsmith) over “the future of killing.”

## Secrets (DM Only)
- Keeps a blade locked away in her shrine—a failed creation from her youth, cursed and whispering.
- Once forged a weapon for the Chained God’s temple but swore never to do it again. They still want her back.

## Adventure Hooks
- Rita needs rare ore from west of the Dagger Flow but refuses to ask the captains.
- One of her apprentices goes missing—last seen leaving with a mysterious customer.
- An old enemy arrives, wielding a weapon Rita made… and meant to destroy.
