# Description
Strange Bones is a gaunt, unpredictable figure who drifts in and out of Rupert’s orbit. Known for speaking in riddles and collecting skeletal curios, they serve as both adviser and jester. Their exact role in Rupert’s plans is unclear, but their presence unsettles allies and enemies alike.

# Personality
- Rambling, cryptic, and unnerving.  
- Fixates on bones as metaphors for truth and destiny.  
- Alternates between laughter and deadly seriousness.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Has visions tied to the Godless Wind.  
- May be keeping Rupert sane—or leading him astray.
