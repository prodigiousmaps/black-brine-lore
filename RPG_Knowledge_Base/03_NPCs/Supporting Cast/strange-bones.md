### **Overview**

There are only a **handful of souls** who have entered the **Western Jungles** and lived to tell of it. **Strange Bones** is one of them—if he ever **felt inclined to tell.**

A **mysterious, soft-footed goblin**, he is one with the jungle, moving **unseen, unheard, and untraceable**. He understands the **laws of the wilds** better than any man, elf, or wizard ever could. The jungle does not suffer **fools or loud men**, and neither does Strange Bones.

If he speaks at all, it is in **short, whispered phrases**—warnings, omens, and commands. Any fool who refuses to listen may **never leave the jungle alive.**

---

### **Appearance**

Strange Bones is **small, wiry, and sinewy**, his **deep green skin** hidden beneath **stitched hides, vines, and mud**. His **mustache and hair are wild**, streaked with silver like the **lichen-covered trees he calls home**. His eyes are **sharp and knowing**, constantly scanning for threats.

He wears a **broad mushroom-cap hat**, repelling rain and sun while allowing him to vanish in the thick canopy. His belt is lined with **bone fetishes, dart pouches, and flasks of antidotes**. He carries a **staff of woven jungle roots** and an **ancient ironwood bow**, both carved with forgotten runes.

### **Personality & Behavior**

- **The Jungle’s Will** – Strange Bones does not command the jungle, nor does it command him. They are **the same.**

- **Speaks in Warnings** – Words are **rare and precious**, spoken only when **necessary for survival.**

- **Dislikes Noise** – Loud people **die first.** If he decides to take you under his wing, he will **train you in silence.**

- **A Reluctant Guide** – The jungle is no place for **civilized fools**, but if he believes you serve a **greater purpose**, he may **show you the way.**

- **Knows the Old Magic** – His connection to the land grants him **druidic wisdom**, allowing him to call upon the **jungle’s ancient spirits** in times of need.

### **Role in the Campaign**

- **Jungle Survival Trainer** – The party must prove themselves before he will **teach them how to move through the jungle unseen**.

- **Expedition Leader** – He will lead the adventurers **deep into the Western Jungles**, where few have returned.

- **Guardian of Forbidden Knowledge** – The ruins and **eldritch horrors of the jungle** are known to him. If the party listens, they might survive.

- **Harbinger of Something Awful** – He has felt **a wrongness in the jungle**, something waking **beneath the roots and the rivers.**

### **Strange Bones' Laws of the Jungle**

1. **The jungle sees, hears, and smells before you do. Keep quiet. Keep low.**

2. **Eat nothing with eyes unless you have no choice.**

3. **If the vines move against the wind, turn around.**

4. **Dead things that do not rot are not dead.**

5. **The first fool to touch the gold dies. The second fool follows him.**
