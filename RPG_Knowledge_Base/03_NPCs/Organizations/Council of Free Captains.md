type: organization
name: Council of Free Captains
location: Black Brine - various districts, primarily Salt Crown and Crosswater taverns
tags: [pirates, politics, factions, captains, independents]

overview: >
  The Council of Free Captains is a loose alliance of ship captains who do not belong to the major ruling fleets but still command enough wealth, crews, or notoriety to demand respect. They maintain their independence fiercely, walking the fine line between cooperation and chaos. While not on the Captain’s Council, they are too influential to ignore—and too unpredictable to fully trust.

members: 30–50 captains

leadership:
  structure: Informal rotating chair, no fixed hierarchy
  most_influential:
    - name: Captain Tella "Coincutter" Varne
      race: Tiefling
      ship: The Gilded Fang
      reputation: Ruthless trader with a flair for cutting off middlemen—literally
    - name: Sallow Fen
      race: Undead Elf (presumed revenant)
      ship: The Hollow Smile
      reputation: Runs ghost routes through cursed waters, speaks only in whispers

goals:
  - Maintain autonomy from the ruling fleets
  - Protect trade routes and crew rights
  - Undermine monopolies held by Rosy’s allies
  - Gain influence on the Captain’s Council through leverage or seats

customs:
  - Each captain must present a unique artifact from a past voyage to be heard at a full moot
  - Duels are allowed but only on water or rooftops—never on docks
  - Decisions made at sea under a full moon are considered binding among members

meeting_place: >
  While the council has no formal hall, they often meet at the upper mezzanine of the Powder Keg Tavern or aboard the floating wreck-ship called "The Drift," anchored just outside the harbor.

reputation: >
  Seen as necessary troublemakers by the ruling fleets and unpredictable allies by the people. Feared by merchants for their power to collectively blockade or raid, should negotiations go poorly.

tensions:
  - Frequently clash with the Widowmakers over assassination bounties
  - Harbor resentment toward Gun Deck Rosy's dominance
  - Dispute sea lanes with Tasty Bite's fleet
  - Occasionally act as mediators between hostile factions—if paid well enough

hooks:
  - A major vote among the Free Captains could sway a Council decision—if someone can sway the swing captains
  - A captain seeks help smuggling a sensitive cargo past Rosy’s patrols
  - A Free Captain’s artifact has gone missing, and without it, their seat is forfeit
