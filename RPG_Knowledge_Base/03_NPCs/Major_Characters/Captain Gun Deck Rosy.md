# Captain "Gun Deck" Rosy

[[image]]

### **Gun Deck Rosy’s Devotion to Sedna**

- Her **fanaticism commands both fear and loyalty**, as people whisper of her **rituals and sacrifices**.

- She might possess **Sedna’s blessings**, granting her unnerving resilience, visions from the depths, or **hexblade powers**.

- **Her ship could be a shrine**—its hull reinforced with deep-sea bones, its figurehead depicting Sedna’s **twisted, hag-like visage**.
