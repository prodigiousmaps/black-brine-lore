# Inquisitor Zunizar

## Overview
Zunizar is one of the most feared inquisitors in Black Brine. Tall, gaunt, and always draped in a long jet-black coat and highly polished boots lined with widow silk, he moves like smoke and strikes like venom. Appointed by the Widowmakers, he balances his duties to the House of Questions with quiet loyalty to his fleet. Where Zunizar walks, silence follows—and no secret stays buried.

## Appearance
He wears a fine velvet coat stitched with silver thread in the shape of floral designs mixed with tentacles. He carries a black walking cane with a silver head in the shape of an octopus. His breath smells faintly of cloves and pipe tobacco. He has a badge of office pinned to his lapel in the shape of an octopus gripping an obsidian stone.

## Personality
Cold, patient, and unnervingly still. Zunizar speaks in a low smooth tones, never raises his voice, and always gives the impression he knows more than he says. He values secrets like currency and prefers manipulation to violence—though he's fluent in both. He has moments of unexpected levity and self-deptrication and a somewhat fatalistic sense of humor.

## Government & Politics
Zunizar's loyalties straddle a razor's edge. He serves the Captain’s Council as inquisitor, but his true allegiance lies with the Widowmakers. This dual loyalty gives him power—and makes him dangerous. He’s known to target rivals under the guise of justice.

## Role in Society
Zunizar investigates treason, sabotage, and forbidden magic. His interrogations are quiet, slow, and final. Citizens dread his knock, and even captains tread lightly around him. He doesn’t issue warnings. He issues truths.

## Adventure Hooks
- Zunizar believes a player character is hiding information and begins a slow, unshakable pursuit.
- A rival inquisitor vanishes, and Zunizar recruits—or coerces—the party into the investigation.
- Rumors swirl that Zunizar has uncovered proof of a heretic within the Captain’s Council.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- Zunizar keeps a private ledger hidden in his quarters that tracks every secret he’s uncovered. If discovered, it could topple half the Council.
- He is bound to an entity he calls the "Admiral" who's motivations are unknown.

## Henchman
Inquisitor Zunizar employs a driver named Silas he is a man of quiet strength and unwavering dedication. A weathered individual in his fifties, his broad frame and grim face speak of a life lived on the fringes, once a sailor with the 'Sea Vipers.' He bears the scars of past encounters, including a particularly harrowing incident involving a deep wreck that "changed" half his crew, leaving him with a deep understanding of the unseen horrors that lurk in Black Brine.
