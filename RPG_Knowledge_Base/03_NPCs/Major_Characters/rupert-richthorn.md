# Rupert Richthorn

[image](https://app.capacities.io/31f71015-b54c-41a2-8667-93c80b54b876/5099e89a-c1ed-4155-a37f-37effec12bc6)

Rupert’s presence in Black Brine makes him a **feared and enigmatic figure**, adding tension and intrigue to the town. His nickname, **“The Kraken,”** suggests that the townspeople see him as **something vast, dangerous, and lurking beneath the surface**—a fitting reputation for an exiled archwizard.

### **Potential Dynamics & Conflicts**

- **A Power Play with Rosy**: Their **tenuous agreement** could shift at any moment—if Rupert oversteps, Rosy may be forced to act.

- **His Forbidden Tower**: Settling **west of town** could lead to **strange magical occurrences, Sedna’s cultists taking interest, or old secrets awakening**.

- **Merchants’ Fear**: Despite his **keen eye for quality**, merchants **hate dealing with him**—his critiques are **brutally honest**, and some believe his purchases **carry a curse**.

- **His Tavern Table**: A place of power—**what happens when someone is foolish enough to sit there?**

- **Hidden Agendas**: He may be using his exile **to experiment with dangerous magic**, seek **artifacts tied to Sedna**, or **rebuild his influence from the shadows**.

### **Rupert’s Life in Black Brine**

- **The Tower in Exile**: His **demiplane-infused tower** is likely well-hidden, either **in the mist-covered cliffs, deep in the jungle, or within a concealed cavern**.

- **Stripped of Influence**: Without his war chest, Rupert **must rely on cunning, magic, and new alliances** to regain power.

- **Enemies Closing In**: Assassins and bounty hunters may still be **searching for him**, unaware he is in Black Brine.

- **Gun Deck Rosy’s Tolerance**: She may allow him to stay **so long as he pays tribute** or offers her something of value—perhaps forbidden magic or strategic guidance.

- **A New Plan**: With Black Brine as his new home, Rupert might be **seeking allies, magical resources, or a way to reclaim his place in the world**.
