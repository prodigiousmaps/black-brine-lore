# Description
Rupert Richthorn is a feared and enigmatic figure in Black Brine, an exiled archwizard whose nickname—**The Kraken**—speaks to his vast, dangerous, and lurking reputation. Townsfolk whisper of his powers and schemes, wary of drawing his attention.

# Potential Dynamics & Conflicts
*Power Play with Gun Deck Rosy*: A tenuous arrangement exists; if Rupert oversteps, Rosy may be forced to act.  
*The Forbidden Tower: His hidden demiplane-infused tower west of town sparks strange magical events and Sedna’s cultist interest.  
- **Merchants’ Fear**: Merchants despise his brutally honest critiques and fear his purchases may carry curses.  
- **The Tavern Table**: His chosen tavern seat has become a place of whispered power; outsiders risk much by sitting there.  
- **Hidden Agendas**: He may be experimenting with forbidden magics, seeking Sedna-linked artifacts, or rebuilding power.  

# Rupert’s Life in Black Brine
- **The Tower in Exile**: Concealed among cliffs, jungle, or caverns, woven with demiplane magic.  
- **Stripped of Influence**: Without his fortune, he must rely on cunning, magic, and alliances.  
- **Enemies Closing In**: Bounty hunters and assassins hunt him, ignorant of his Black Brine refuge.  
- **Gun Deck Rosy’s Tolerance**: She permits his stay only if he offers tribute—be it gold, magic, or strategy.  
- **A New Plan**: In exile, he seeks allies, resources, and pathways to reclaim lost influence.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Rupert may be studying ways to unbind Sedna’s chains.  
- His tower contains an unstable rift to another plane.  
- The Kraken nickname comes from a true pact with something in the deeps.
