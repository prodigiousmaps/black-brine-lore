Apprentice story - Disappears well on scouting patrol. Found the next day unresponsive. Brought to his master and then explosion, investigation to interview soldiers
party finds large scorched crater: Arcana traston & mirakas
teal shards and glass. insight Otho & Luka, explosion source, Outward trajectory
The party finds a notebook and Aperture containing the musings of their captain
there is mention of an object called an aperture
there is speculation that the aperture is for spell storage
there is a series of diagrams
circle
array
others (scratched out)
How do apertures work!
Allows for the transfer of power (spell slots).
Each wielder must use an attunement slot
any caster can use an aperture. If you have spell slots or pact slots you may attune to an aperture.
Each individual chooses how many slots they will contribute to the pool.
Power: One spell slot equals one spell level.
Focus may take levels to cast spells they already know to a maximum of 9th level
Levels may be used to “upcast” as spell as stated in the spell description
Configuration: The arrangement of casters imparts special benefits
Discovering Configurations - Must be done through experimentation
A configuration may be attempted with successful arcana check DC18
Following a configuration attempt the exact properties of that configuration may be discerned with an identify spell.
Vulnerabilities
While connected casters must maintain concentration
Casters may move at the rate afforded by the slowest caster
Casters may not double move or dash
Maintaining the configuration requires that contributors dedicate bonus actions and reactions
The focus may use all actions but movement is restricted
All casters must maintain a distance from each other of no more than 20 feet.
Changing configuration takes a bonus action from each connected mage
The effects of casting are dependent on the configuration of the linking.
Configurations - Current configurations
Circle configuration - flexible but less powerful. Any caster in the circle may utilize the pool of power.
Array configuration - all casters are individually connected to a single focus caster. Only the focus may cast spells utilizing the pool however all spells are cast with advantage.
Linear configuration - casters are connected in a chain terminating with the focus. Only the focus may cast spells utilizing the pool. A single caster may only be the focus once per short rest. attacks are double damage, auto hit, max effect, etc.
Bomb - Power may be added to a single focus by multiple casters to be released at once but the aperture is destroyed in the process.
The Command Tent
Following a day of investigation, camp setup and obtaining horses the PCs will meet with the command team to report their findings.

Prepping gear-Groups of men prepping gear, tents, brushing horse etc lots of activity
Commanders will engage and will gather at a command fire outside the general’s tent
Soldiers can be heard singing a song called “big swinging schmidts”
Rupert will bring a case of wine and hand out bottles of Pwyll private reserve. “A little something I pilfered from a previous employer. I know you all have suffered a loss today so let us honor all who have fallen in the gods forsaken”
Rupert will give a toast to the lives lost in the unborn war
Antti - The dentist assassin- he could pull your teeth or your card. Died in a murder suicide.  He very much hated his mother apparently.
Tyravor - He looked down the throat of a dragon and never flinched, even as his noble faced melted
Castor Sprag - Sadly, rumor has it he was shanked on the streets of Athkatla by a skeleton who claimed he owed him money
Chilini - Who I understand shacked up with a milkmaid in Murann and is working on his third child…fate worse than death if you ask me.
And of course, Sylmaris - Brains hopelessly scrambled and awaiting a prince that will never come. A foul end for a foul mouthed princess
“To these and many more unfortunates...or possibly fortunates?  May they live on in our memory but not occupy too much space as we shall need all of our wits to survive in the days to come.”

Lheshayle soldiers have begun digging below the blight.  It seems to be working but the going is slow due to their lack of experience
Attempts to communicate magically have been blocked by something powerful
Trade pressure and the impending attack
Grain is rotting in warehouses
A slow trickle of goods is starting to move but the way is dangerous

The districts - city map - Make city map and all others

Lancestride - Temple district
A siege within a siege is the doom guides hold up in their temple and oppose the unborn
Lordrest - Middle to lower class area, currently closed
Swordsong - Market district
Brightgate - Noble district
Economy
Nothing new is coming in and nothing is going out
Scarcity is an issue and prices are going up
Money has less value than goods in trade
Politics
I there are many rumors about the fate of the Lord
His last address to the populace was weeks ago, before the invasion
The populace is divided, some believe the Lord caused the disaster in his pursuit of power. Others believe he would fight to the death for his city, but both parties think he is long dead.
The government has devolved from a monarchy into a collection of squabbling district councils
Although the city is technically lawless, the threat of the unborn keeps everyone in fear
Edicts from the castle appear overnight posted on the walls and message boards around the city. These missives usually address, curfew, travel, restrictions, and offers of rewards in exchange for information on dissidence.
Enemy forces
Unborn Man, the walls
Many of them are former guards who are turned into something else
There is a curfew
Death squads room, the streets at night, and sometimes whole families disappear, leaving vacant homes around the city
Populace
Much of the populace, continuing to work for something to do
People have lost love ones and a large percentage of the population is in morning
The horse holocaust
The middle class district has been closed and no one has gone in or out in several weeks
Families have been split and haven’t heard from their loved ones
Transport
The streets are clogged with people and traveling by horse is not an option
There are carriages that will take parties from place to place, but the fees are exorbitant and sometimes it’s faster to walk
The market district, and the temple district are choked with refugees from other parts of the city, who are living in the streets or abandon buildings, making it difficult to navigate the streets even on foot
When night comes everyone scrambles for a roof to sleep under, lest they be in violation of the curfew
The guild - velvet hammer
Shaetta
No longer committing crimes against the general populace
Distributing supplies and gathering information
Something inside the walls. Not sure what it is but when it was moved in it was in a large wooden box 5’ x 5’.
Not been able to investigate further, because the walls are crawling with unborn.
The guild can provide secret travel and intelligence about the castle
The castle does not appear to be guarded, but they have not ventured inside
The guild does not know a way in other than the front gate or scaling the wall
Missives come from inside the castle and are posted by unborn slaves.
Lowertown is devastated. They’ve investigated but I’ve seen no signs of life. Velvet hammer spies were sent in as recently as a week ago but never returned.
They have a birth mask
Market district
Setup - There is a mage with an aperture in the market district transferring power to broadcast source  supporting the blight.  The party needs to disable it.
The facts
The mage is hidden among the population
The mage is a conduit between the mages coven in the castle and the Foci-Aperture - Aperture immersed a globe filled with amniotic
The Foci-Aperture amplifies power and augments concentration.
Mage coven is able to project and amplify power to it and sense through it if connected
Mage coven is able to control unborn on the walls through proxy
What the players know
The blight is a magical effect
The magical effect must be supported with continuous power
That power must be delivered
There are three hidden objects - These could be the broadcast sources
Intelligence
From thieves guild
Something was moved into the wall in the market district.
It is heavily guarded by a company of unborn soldiers
If informed about the mechanics of the apertures, Shaetta will speculate that there must be a conduit mage hidden in the market
Shaette will ask, “what happens if we eliminate the conduit?”
She will agree to capture and unborn in exchange for what is inside the wall
Suicide
Nevel will be found praying before the pit
His mind is broken
He will throw himself down the pit
Malbee will give him his sword and his blessing
Be at peace
Malbee will interrupt the party if this attempt to stop him
“He has chosen to take Kelemvor’s path while he still possesses the ability to discern it’s markings”
From Lord Quwinn
The attack story
The appeared in his audience chamber materializing from nowhere
My people are suffering and I am powerless to stop it
Let me lead the assault, I know the vulnerabilities.
Smuggle me out
Coven mages - at least 4
Cast surrounded by magic barrier
Barrier opens when missives are released
Interrogation of unborn yields nothing
Unborn in the city are centrally controlled
Powerful amplification is at work
Unborn are not patrolling the gardens
Ormath is a distraction - What is the motive
Coven is not pursuing power
Not pursuing money or control of trade
Lord has been stalking the market district trying to trace the thread of power
He is not using detect magic so as not to give himself away
What is distinctive about the conduit?
Perception - DC 20
Not Ormathian
Well fed
Stink of magic
Special interest for players
Traston - Advantage on checks against aperture connections
Mirakas - Advantage on checks to identify functionality of the foci
Otho - Danger Sense - mood and reactions of the people - Advantage
Luca - Lord Quwen - advantage on all interactions
The Fallout
After the battle in the market district the group is alerted that the unborn have moved the foci in the bright gate and are probably doing the same in the dead district.  The guild is tracking the location of foci in bright gate
The dead district is the one place that would be best entered at night
Lord Quwen - Lower town is devoid of citizen and life but the unborn are up to something in there.  We have a foci there and some other activity.
Thieves guild and provide a way in. through the sewer
