Lord Quwen suspects that Lahshayl is trying take control of Ormath by any means.  Ideally they would like political control but in the absense of that they will attempt to crush the city financially.  He needs proof that this is happening so he can make his case in mediation. The team has 2 days to gather the evidence and will have to split into two teams on each day

            2. Holloway will not accept allowing lahshyl soldiers taking orders from Ormath officials

            3. A provisional governor and mediator for Assam has been appointed to resolve the dispute and build provisional government

        5. The merchant guilds of Ormath are in disarray and trying desperately to hold on to their businesses

            2. Many suppliers in multiple industries have moved on to other opportunities

            3. The cost of running caravans has risen dramatically

                1. Cost of horses

                2. Cost of qualified guards

            3. The selected government will travel to Assam to ratify the treaty on neutral ground in the presence of and with the signature of all three Lords of the shining planes with officials from the city states of Hlondeth and Nathlekh as witness

    4. The arguments

        1. Lord Quwen

            1. Ormath is a city state with its own culture and proud tradition that stretches back centuries

            2. Submission of Lehshayl rule will never happen regardless of a treat

                1. Citizens have pride and have fought too hard to save their city

                2. Citizens will not accept outside occupation

                3. Occupation and chaos sown by it, will stifle trade and distract from the most important thing, keeping Pikes Folly open and trade flowing

                4. The best way for the city to recover is to restore open trade as soon as possible NOT shady deals and predatory loans

    5. A deadly dinner

        1. First course - The Barrister/Lord Meeter - thin cuts of red meat seared and served with a sweet pepper sauce and savory breads

            1. Black hair ponytail with ribbon, regal bearing, formal, mustache, gray suit with white ruffled shirt, pin of office on lapel

            2. ARGUMENT - Order is being kept on the streets by soldiers of Lheshayl.  There is no Ormathian security to speak of and the burden of securing the trade route will fall heavily to Lheshayl for years to come. The idea that we would throw vast quantities of our treasure and manpower at this city while also screeding control of our forces to an Ormathian figurehead is ludicrise.

            3. COUNTER ARGUMENT - The people of Ormath sacrificed everything to protect the shining plains. Do they really think that the unborn would have stopped at Ormath? Does anyone really believe the people of this city will countenance another occupation? Believe me when I tell you that is how it will be seen. PARTY CONTRIBUTION

            4. Uncover the plot to secure land deeds through insurance deals - Lheshayl is offering people housing in exchange for the deeds to their lots

            5. Citizens are being offered new housing for low rent but the details of these contracts stipulate a tripling of rent after 2 years

            6. Heist - Search Barrister’s office and find the notes

                1. Track the barrister (Stealth DC16) to embassy

                2. Break into office (Lock DC 18) break into embassy

                3. Search office (Investigation DC 20, Lock DC18)

                4. FIND an example of a contract

                    1. Investigation DC20 will show the trap in the fine print

                    2. Find traps will show it immediately

        2. Second course - The Philanthropist/Lord Szorin - Green salad featuring dried fruits and nuts. Dressing of oil, vinegar, sumac berries & honey

            1. Overweight, red suit, white and gold sash, well groomed chestnut hair and beard

            2. ARGUMENT - The people of Ormath are suffering, beyond security they need shelter and food all of which take time, finances and most importantly human resources. Lheshayl is providing the lion’s share of the commitment and has been very generous…more than Ormath deserves.

            3. COUNTER ARGUMENT- The one thing Ormath still has is a treasury and has contributed significant coin to the recovery. Have you seen what is going on in Lower town? Yes, the people need homes but lower town will forever be known as Lheshayl town.  The people will lose all sense of self or tradition. Our saviors are taking liberties with the soul of our city and the longer this goes on unchecked the harder it will be for Ormath to remain the proud city it has been for hundreds of years. It bears mentioning that after our liberators arrived, cast Qwen was mysteriously stripped of its many valuables including relics of considerable historical significance. I cannot help but wonder if Lheshayl’s intent is to erase any trace of Ormath including it proud heritage.  LORD HOLLOWAY “Outrageous!” LORD QUWEN Perhaps Lord Holloway hopes that by eliminating all traces of Ormath he can somehow also strike Lheshyl’s many losses on the battlefield from the histories! PARTY CONTRIBUTION

            4. Uncover the plot to secure the loyalty of community groups - Lheshayl is trying to secure the loyalty and good will of community leaders through bribes and payoffs.

                1. Track the Philanthropist (Stealth DC18) follow to chappel

                4. Attendees are being offered money and/or property in exchange

        3. Third course - The Accountant/Lord Blacktree - Roast pheasant

            1. Tall, thin, hawk nose.  Silver hair, black suit, well groomed

            2. ARGUMENT - Ormath must consent to accept help.  It’s not just the city, farm land surrounding the city has been poisoned and its herds decimated.  The city cannot produce enough food to feed its own people let alone field any cavalry to defend surrounding settlements and trade routes.

            3. COUNTER ARGUMENT - Ormath does not need handouts, it needs a hand up! Equipment, seed, horses we are asking to buy these things and yet Lheshayle insists on predatory leases.  They are attempting to deal the killing blow by making Ormath a financial vassal! RUPERT This is a non-issue. It is possible to reinvigorate blighted farmland by magical means. BLACK STREET Oh of course it is wizard and how much will that cost Lheshayl? The last thing the Shining Plains needs are a bunch of unscrupulous wizards traipsing around grifting the populace.  RUPERT Breathtaking hypocrisy Lord Blackstreet. I understand your textile business finds itself dangerously in arrears on its loan payments? Perhaps that is where we should start investigating this grift you speak of. PARTY CONTRIBUTION

            4. Uncover the plot to secure building contracts - Lheshayl is attempting to secure building contracts for the Dark District

            5. Interrogation - Follow the accountant to city hall and find out who he is meeting with and interrogate/interview them

                1. Track the accountant (Stealth DC18) Follow to temple

                2. Identify who he is meeting with- Clerk

                3. Interrogate the clerk

                    1. The clerk is being paid in horses to tip the scales in favor of Lehshayl building contractors

                    2. He has already acquired a substantial herd

        4. Fourth course - The Politician/High Lord Holloway  - trifle, vanilla cream, thin layers of cake and berries.

            1. White robes of office trimmed in green. Medium length blond hair, goatee, multiple rings, Lords council amulet

            2. ARGUMENT - Let’s talk about the man. Lord Quwen’s legacy is soaked in blood. 1352 - The Wet River massacre, incited by this man over fishing rights. 1354 - The Ten Paw war, this man drives 550 Lheshayle settlers from their homes displacing them with Wimic tribal filth.  1360 - Deepwing conflict, this man decides to claim grazing lands everyone knows are the domain of fire drakes. The incursion drives the drake into Lheshayle territory destroying 3 villages and killing 260 men, women and children.1361 - 

            3. COUNTER ARGUMENT - Your selective remembering of history is entertaining but let’s get to the heart of it. 1368 - I killed your father, chief Jirdan Holloway in single combat before the walls of Assam. I always respected your father.  He was a strong and decisive leader and an excellent opponent for many years prior to the Pact of Assam.  Don’t allow your anger to distort your view of history, young Holloway.  The Pact of Assam has kept the Shining Plains stable for some time now and your father was prepared to throw it away for conquest. I assure you, if Jirdan had not agreed to settle the matter by crossing swords with me, Lheshayle would not exist today. The Shining Plains has long been a country of pride and conflict. Accusing me of bloodlust is an indictment of our entire history. Yes, I have been aggressive, even warlike but I have also presided over 15 years of relative peace. History will judge me not you.  PARTY CONTRIBUTION

            4. Uncover the plot to pay off Assamian diplomats to snub Lord Qwen in exchange for land deeds.

            5. Intercept - Chase down a messenger ([Hellspawn Hawk](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Hellspawn_Hawk_(5e_Creature))) from Ormath to Assam and capture the evidence

        5. OUTCOME

            1. Magistrate Dulan - Young, short black hair, clean shaven, shrewd eyes, tan, red and black suit, limp, cane

            2. Thank you gentlemen, I appreciate that dialogue we have had here tonight. It is surely a sign of our continued progress as a nation of proud city states that we are able to settle our differences at the negotiation table rather than the battlefield.

                This negotiation is a complicated one to be sure but in the interest of peace I intend to render my decision immediately.  Do not think I am being rash as I have dedicated months of my own research to this situation.

                It cannot be denied that the citizens of Ormath have sacrificed much, not just for their city but for the Shining Plains.  I dare say the outcomes might have been very different had the Unborn horde chosen to occupy Assame or Lheshayle instead. This is their home and they deserve the utmost consideration in the resolution of this conflict.

                It also cannot be denied that the citizens of Lheshayle are bearing a considerable burden in manpower and treasure to maintain security in this city and Pikes Folly.

                Let me remind you all that you have agreed to this arbitration in writing and any attempt to subvert this verdict will be at best a jailable offense and at worst, an act of war. 

                1. Lheshyle will continue to provide security for Pikes Folly however Lheshyle is in no way authorized to restrict travel or levee taxes or fines.

                2. Lheshyle will continue to provide patrols in the surrounding countryside however Lheshayle is not allowed to demand fealty, resupply or shelter from its residence.

                3. The walls and streets of Ormath will be patrolled by Ormath soldiers alone.  Lord Quwen shall call back his remaining reserves from the hills to provide this service to their city. This is nonnegotiable.

                4. Lord Quwen will resume his role as Lord of Ormath and assemble a new cabinet. Considering the many outside investments required to rebuild the city in the coming years, both Assam and Lheshayl will claim one seat each in this cabinet with voting power equal to all others.Lord Quwen, this will be the standard 6 member cabinet, nothing irregular.

                    1. The first order of business will be to negotiate a fair tax to be paid by Ormath to Lheshayle for the security of its border and the trade routes.

                    2. Second order of business will be to formulate a plan for the restoration of blighted lands. It is of the utmost importance that we get our farmers back on their feet.

                    3. Third order of business arrange for relief supplies for the populace sourcing from outside the shining plains as much as possible.  Our own grain stores will be strained in the coming year and many of our people will fall back on subsistence farming for survival. Due to the Pikeman's Folly, our realms has been bless with many years of wealth gentlemen, it's time to open the coffers

                5. I will step down as magistrate of Ormath in 30 days time but will continue my oversight of this treaty for a period of 2 years at which point we will conduct a review for the purpose of evaluating the success of the Ormath project.

                6. Now, in light of the malfeasance revealed in this meeting it has become clear that these steps are not enough.

                    1. Leshyle will vacate the embassy and leave the city in 2 days time or be forcefully ejected.

                    2. All land deeds, lease agreements and building contracts will be rendered null and an investigation will be conducted by the magistrates of Assam

                    3. All building construction in Lower Town will be halted and an assessment will be conducted to determine how the work completed thus far can best serve the needs of the populace with oversight by Lord Quwen and his cabinet.

                    4. This man will be immediately arrested and placed on trial for treason, all of his ill gotten assets are now the property of Ormath.  This should give Ormath a considerable head start on restoring its herd.

                        That is it.  Thank you gentlemen, you are dismissed.
