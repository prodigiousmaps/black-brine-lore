# Infiltration – Temple of Sedna

**Level 6 adventure for Pinch, Franklin, and Sy (2–3 hours).**

---

## Area 1: Entrance Tunnel

**Description**  
Slippery, barnacle-covered steps descend into salt-choked air. The temple is quiet, but the deeper rooms hiss and breathe with the tide.

**Hazards**
- *Salt Scab Trap*: Pressure plate covered in salt crystals.  
  - Dex Save DC 14 → 3d10 piercing + grappled.
- *Bioluminescent Barnacles*: Loud movement causes them to glow (Stealth disadvantage for 1 minute).

**Clues**
- Fresco: A woman with a sewn mouth, three ritual bowls before her; only the **water-filled bowl** is untouched by eels.  
- Inscription: *“Her breath is not ours to keep.”*

**Creatures**  
None, but noise echoes carry throughout.

A massive open space with a collapsed ceiling and a stagnant tidepool in the center. Mossy offerings rot in broken urns. Stone pews lie cracked and shifting.

A circular chamber with ritual bowls, a black obsidian chest overgrown with coral, and a cracked mirror veiled in barnacles.

**Puzzle** – Unlocking the **Codex of Salt and Shadow**:
1. Maintain **silence** for 1 round (noise resets).  
2. Pour **seawater into the water bowl**.  
3. Speak aloud: *“Her breath is not ours to keep.”*
