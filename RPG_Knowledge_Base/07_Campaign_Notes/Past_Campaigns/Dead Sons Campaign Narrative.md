Von Nevel addresses the company

Alright quiet down ya bastards.

I know its been a difficult day for you lot and I recon you got plenty of questions. Its been a long spell since the sons took a loss like this.  I know many of you counted Ruben as a friend which is a gods damned divine miracle given what an asshole he was. No offense curate…

None taken, truer words have never been spoken. [laughter]

Although he was prickly bastard in the best of times, Ruben was one of the founders of this grand mess we call the Dead Sons and I recon no one worked harder to keep us all alive than he did. Gods knows he was a pain in my ass for years but no matter how you felt about the man he was your best friend when that counter spell hit the shield wall and who could forget the sight of balls of fire sailing overhead while at full charge.  It was glorious if I am being honest.

It’s our tradition to honor our dead with a celebration but that’s not in the cards this time lads.  We got a job to do and time is short.  Rest assured that Curate Sorark has interred them with dignity and it is my intention to move the bodies when our work is all sorted. For now we remember their names with the honor and respect afforded true sons of the dead.

We remember…

Ruben - Leader of worst group of mage degenerates on the shining plains

Farley - Couldn’t hold his liquor but never stopped practicing

Eillith - Cute as a button but her left hook was legendary

Norfir - Quick with a joke and shitty at cards

Amvi - The las had a few opinions [laughter]. Nose always in a book when it wasn’t in my business

Corver - The little apprentice wasn’t so little no more. 16 and already a man.

[silence]

It goes without saying their loss will be felt for a long time to come on the battlefield and in camp.  If you need to hash out your feelings on it, the curate’s tent is open. I mean it lads, we got a dangerous road ahead so no fucking about.

Now, before you start getting all contrary, Sespech has been kind enough to send us some of their finest. This lot comes highly recommended and in addition to covering your asses on the march I have asked them to look into the events of last night. I reckon we all could use some answers and a good night’s sleep. I expect you bastards to afford them every courtesy. I’m looking at you Higgins. Before you start dreaming up hazing rituals for the greens, be thinking about who is going to keep you from choking in a cloud of poison gas. Besides these ones are on loan, they ain’t gonna be around to pull your ass out of the fire, not forever least ways.

Okay then, on to the matters of the day. As you may be smelling, cutty has prepared for us the finest of fare. [grones] Oh knock it off! You know the drill.  We keep it simple on the march.  Keeping you bastards fed on the move ain’t easy and Cutty makes the best slop this side of the dragon coast. Besides, it’s payday, that ought to soothe the sting a bit. [clapping]

Most of you boys ain’t attended a siege. A siege is its own special kind of hell so get your heads right on that. As such, Bruce will be starting nightly infantry drills.[grones] Attendance is required! Until then, it’s combat march protocols boys. Captain Strongboots will be setting up Reckon shifts for flank riders and rear guard.  Captain Faratta will be leading a Vanguard that will include our new friends and a few light cavalry.

The way ain’t hard so you can expect long days, 30-40 miles if we can get it.  We’re heading up Pikemen’s Folly through Deepwing Valley.  We should have access to water for the first two days but after the deepwing river it’s gonna be dry for three days or more.  Keep your flasks wet boys. You know what happens if you come whining to Cutty for his cook water…[laughter]

Combat camp means what?

“Only fires for cooking and eyes always looking”

Very good!

Before we adjourn, I hear honorifics are in order for Mr. York Goldmaul! Today York was chosen by Gloomwind! Congratulations boy, you got the nod from the most cantankerous mare in the whole outfit! Not sure how you did it…maybe she’s just bored.[laughter and back slapping]

Alright ya bastards, line up for some golden porridge.

(Well that went surprisingly well.  Wait till they find out we are cutting double ale rations tomorrow.)

City Bustle

Here is my travel machnic for waterdeep.

Traveling in the city:

Players have several options for getting around town. Travel times are as follows (From south ward)

Walking: Takes- Trade ward - 1 hour Dock ward - 1 hour City of the dead - 2 hour Castle ward  - 2 hour North Ward -  3 hours Sea Ward - 4 Hours

Drays: - cost 2 nibs

Like horse drawn busses. Drays are multi passenger public transportation. There are several stations scattered throughout each ward. A Drays can be taken every 20 minutes starting at 7 am. 

Route 1:  Trade Ward - 15 minutes  North Ward - 30 minutes  Sea Ward - 1 hour Route 2:  Dock ward - 15 minutes  Castle Ward 30 minutes Route 3: (from trade ward)   North Ward - 15 minutes   Sea ward - 30 minutes   Castle Ward - 1 Hour   Trade ward - 1 hour 15 minutes If players chose this option allow one less location to be visited to account for walking between stations

Hire-coach - cost negotiated, no more than 6 nibs. Consider using a luck roll to generate other fare offers.

1-3 No coach available

4-6 Fare bids  5 nibbs

6-9 Fare bids 4 nibbs

9-12 Fare bids 3 nibs

12-15 Fare bids 2 nibs

15-17 Fare bids 1 nib

17-20 Free coach

Same travel times as the Drays without waiting, only two creatures of medium size can ride at a time. Comes with the benefit of being dropped off directly at a designated location. If players chose this option allow 1 more location to be visited to account for not having to walk.

A note about time: When your player are gathering their gear do not forget about the passage of time. Traveling between wards, and wandering shops all expand this resources. In addition if they cross over meal periods characters should start getting hungry. At your discretion, players should be allowed to visit 4 shops during a 4 hour period. Shopping in the south ward should take the better part of three hours. Accounting for walking, random interactions, and traffic difficulties. If you would like to have players roll a luck check to see if they get stuck in a crowded, or have to wait for a coach. All luck rolls should be a DC 10 If players spend to much time in town remember to have them wait until the next day to leave, or suffer exhaustion.

Odd shops.  Need a hat?  Big hats, small hats, fur hats,  fishing hats, even wigs!  We got it all, including the latest styles and hat accessories the duke and duchess are wearing!

Puppets???  Bet your wooden ass we got puppets, from the smallest toy soldier to full sized mannequins, we got your puppet needs covered!

Souvenirs?  First time in Waterdeep?  Well, you will surely want a token to remember this wondrous occasion!

Exotic food stands.  Wyvern ribs, cockatrice leg, and a side of dire squirrel stew will fill your belly!
