# Fallen City Rupert Richthorn Memory Palace

Ruper Richthorn

In the memory palace

1. What does he know?

    1. He was transported by an Astral Projection spell

    2. The spell was hidden inside a Glyph of Warding spell

        1. This means it was cast onsite

        2. The Astral Projection spell was unfamiliar

            1. It is a similar spell but designed to target an individual

            2. Requires an extremely advanced understanding of spell engineering

            3. In the box was a chunk of stone broken from a structure he was able to match to a piece of architecture at the destination

            4. The stone is not native to the Orsauran Mountains

        3. The traditional rules of Astral Projection

            1. Technically he could kill his astral self and teleport back but given the sophistication of the spell, he is doubtful it would work

            2. The enemy has been thorough and he finds himself at the center of their plot.Â  There are advantages to staying.

    3. He is trapped within an antimagic field at the destination

        1. His cell is a combination of anti-magic field with a wall of force

        2. He is unable to use spells or magic items and is unable to breach the wall

    4. What does he see now?

        1. He is in a large stone chamber featuring ornate stone architecture

        2. He is not familiar with the style

        3. The room contain a dias and the force walls extend to its edges

        4. There is a single lantern outside the wall

        5. He has been provided a cot and a basin of water

        6. He was delivered food by a vermin Lord mage

2. What else can he tell them

    1. Given his research, he is confident he is in the Orsauran Mountains

    2. Not sure where as scrying does not work

    3. Talk to Strongboots, he is on retainer to Lord Quwen

    4. Deliver research to Lord Quwen and talk to Strongboots while you're at it
