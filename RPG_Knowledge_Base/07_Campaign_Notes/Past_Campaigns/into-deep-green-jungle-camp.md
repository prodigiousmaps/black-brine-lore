# Narrative
The jungle canopy sways like a living ceiling while the forest floor lies in
stifling stillness. The path winds through massive trees, deadfalls, and mossy
stone. At trail’s end lies a dry cave, etched with ship names and tally marks.
Discarded supplies and strange offerings hint at failed expeditions.

# The Cave
- Old base camp with crates, lanterns, maps, and journals.
- A clay statue of a serene figure sits on a shelf.
- From behind massive roots, a slow rhythmic clicking is heard.
- Signs of Fifth Mouth cult influence are scattered among the items.

# Mechanics
- If the party rests here, the cave amplifies dreams, especially when handling
  the mask or shrine.
- Use this encounter to foreshadow the Hollow Song’s effects.
