NARRATIVE

The jungle is alive with sound. Insects drone in the undergrowth and the haunting calls of unknow birds fill the humid air. You are surrounded by thick lush greenery in all directions cut through with a single narrow dirt path that rises and falls over hills concealed in a dense layer of plant life, dead falls and the dry blanket of leaves from season past conceal the soil below.

High above the canopy sways in the wind giving the appearance of a living ceiling of green and gray so thick it block much of the sun. The air around you presses in smelling of fresh rain, damp earth and loam. As you walk the path, the jungle brushes you with moisture, dampening your clothes.

The path takes you through the deep green, around massive trees, under dead falls, and over rocky outcrops covered in moss. In this place is endless, eternal and massive in a way that inspired  both awe and dread.

THE CAVE

1. Map - small cave map

2. Supplies

ü™µ OLD BASE CAMP INVENTORY

Located in a small dry cave at the end of the jungle trail (Hex 1).

The camp smells of old wood smoke, salt, and mold. Faint etchings are scratched into the cave wall: ship names, tally marks, and pictograms featuring creatures unrecognizable to you.  The cave is scattered with discarded items, some very old and others, strangely preserved. Broken crates, a smashed check, a discarded pack and other items litter the floor.

One wall is solid that rises from the dirt floor to the ceiling to reveal and hole open to the air.  Dappled daylight shines through a net of vines and roots to light the small cavern below.  On a stone shelf rests a clay statue of a serene figure in apparent meditation.

The opposite wall is covered in massive roots from the great trees above and covered in ivy.  From behind the greenery comes a slow rhythmic clicking noise.

üí° Mechanics:

- Use this as a foreshadowing moment: Show signs of unraveling minds, failed expeditions, and the early effects of the Hollow Song.

- If they rest here, the cave amplifies dreams‚Äîespecially if they handle the mask or shrine.



üìú¬†Journal Fragment ‚Äì Entry VIII

Recovered from the cave camp near the trail‚Äôs end, ink faded but legible.

Entry VIII

The air changes the further in we go. The canopy thickens not from growth, but from intent. It‚Äôs like the trees are leaning closer to hear us.

Nara says the trail is older than anything we‚Äôve seen. Stone cut smooth, but choked by vine and bone-root. She found a coin half-swallowed by the mud: same make as Waterdeep, but the face was wrong. No crown. Just a mouth. Open.

We marked three trees to trace our return path. By dusk, there were four‚Äîand I know none of us carved the last.

Dovain seems‚Ä¶ calmer than the rest. At night he listens for something. He told me:

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt hear it yet. It‚Äôs not sound. It‚Äôs shape.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what that means. I don‚Äôt think I want to.

I had a dream last night. I was beneath the roots of a giant tree. No sun. No sound. A song that made my teeth ache.

I woke up chewing on my finger.

Tomorrow we press deeper. Nara says we‚Äôre close. A stone spire rises behind the trees to the South but we haven't explored that direction yet. I am beginning to think it was a mistake to begin our journey by magic means.  It saved time but we have little sense of where we are or how to get back.

If this is my last entry, let it be known: I came here for riches.

But the jungle has no gold. Only hunger.

‚Äî J.

MEANWHILE

8 hours behind them a jungle monster (drawn by the sound of Sy's eldritch blast and the smell of blood) picks of their sent at the river and begins to follow. The spiny Ravthings are too hard to eat but whatever killed them smells good.
