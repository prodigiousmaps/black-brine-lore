NARRATIVE

Part one - having obtained a baring you begin picking your way through the jungle.  The move through the undergrowth finding your way through clusters of massive trees and thick vines. You arrive at the bank of a small creek.  This area is shallow with a series of stones arranged in a crossing.

Part 2 -  the path leading from the creek is faint and often difficult to follow but requires less cutting.  The jungle grows darker as the canopy high above thickens. Insect noise intensifies but bird and animal calls have faded. You enter a small clearing of bare soil and dry leaves and above the hum of insects you hear faint and seemingly random chimes. The remains of a stone fire ring lay at the center of the roughly 20x20 circle.  Inspection of the perimeter reveals a network of faded and broken strings attached to tiny copper bells green with age.

NAVIGATION CHECK - success reveals the location of Vexir and the location of the green band before them.  DC14 Arcana reveals the thickness of the wall to be roughly 300'.
