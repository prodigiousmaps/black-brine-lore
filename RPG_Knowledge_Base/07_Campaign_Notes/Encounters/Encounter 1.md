# Encounter 1

1. UP RIVER - 6 HOURS PER HEX, 3 HEX PER DAY



Threat Level = 0

Rupert has chartered a non-descript fishing boat to sail them to the mouth of the Black River
​Strange bones will guide them to the mouth of the Black River Inlet and will jump off on the shore.  Sy will navigate the boat up stream.

WEATHER

5-**Dense Jungle Fog**

Disadvantage on ranged attacks and Perception. Encounter chance increased by +1.

11-**Jungle Silence**

No insects, birds, or rustling. PCs gain advantage on Stealth, but encounter DC lowered (higher risk).

ENCOUNTER

9-Twisting currents—boats must **navigate or capsize** in whirlpool

11-A pod of **river spirits** swim alongside silently; they vanish if spoken to

5-**Floating fungal mat**—causes mild hallucinations for 1 hour

**Mood**: Tense, oppressive, but natural


​2. RIVER BARRICADE - 

The Soiled have collapsed a portion of an old ruin black passage to boats. The PCs will have to ground their raft and continue on foot

Absolutely. Here’s a full encounter package built around this moment of tension on the Black River tributary, designed to feel like a cinematic ambush, with layered environmental danger, opportunistic enemies, and multiple player choices.



🌿 Encounter: The Skull Garden of the Black River

Location:

 The players’ raft glides to a halt as the river becomes choked by fallen stone and ancient debris. The left bank rises steeply, crowned by vine-choked ruins and a looming obelisk. The right bank is lower—sandy, half-submerged, with an eerily tranquil beach.



🎭 Set Dressing & Atmosphere

- Left Bank (High Ground):

    - Mossy ruins with steps leading up into vine-draped chambers

    - A leaning obelisk engraved in old spiral runes

    - Jungle birds fall silent when approached

- Right Bank (Low Ground):

    - Sandy clearing

    - A giant skull partially buried, tangled in delicate-looking flowering vines

    - Beside it, a motionless armored corpse, mask cracked but still grim

    - Distant movement in the brush—watchers?



⚠️ Environmental Hazards

🌸 False Beauty Vines

(CR 3 environmental hazard)

- Appear as gorgeous flowering creepers with purple-pink blossoms

- When a creature moves within 10 feet of the skull, the vines spring to life:

    - Attack all within range with +5 to hit, 2d6 piercing + 1d6 acid

    - Grapples on hit (DC 14 to escape)

    - If left alone, they attempt to drag prey into the skull’s mouth cavity over 1–2 rounds

- Immune to charm; vulnerable to fire



👺 Predators in the Brush

(Opportunists – CR 2–3 group)

Hide in the undergrowth across the river, watching both banks. These scavengers are:

Ravethings

(custom beast – CR ½ each)

- Hairless, slinking jungle canines with retractable spines and clever eyes

- Move like jackals but strike with packs and distraction

- AC 13, HP 18

- Pack Rush: If a creature is restrained or grappled, ravethings gain advantage on attacks

- Spine Flurry (Recharge 5–6): Each creature in 10-ft cone must make a DC 13 DEX save or take 2d6 piercing



🧠 Tactics:

- Wait for someone to trigger the vines

- Cross the shallow part of the river (or leap from stones) during the chaos

- Try to drag bodies into the woods, especially if PCs fall unconscious

- Sink the raft



🛑 The Armored Corpse

- Upon inspection (if they survive the vines), the corpse holds:

    - A ritual mask of the Cult of the Hollow Song (AC +1 if worn, but slowly induces nightmares over 3 nights)

    - A bound scroll: ancient map fragment showing ruins and a symbol for the Temple of the Hollow Song

    - A strange blade (dull black, jagged)—not magical, but designed to sacrifice rather than fight

🧪 Optional Clue: If anyone investigates the skull itself, they may notice ancient carvings in the bone referencing “the First Hunger,” a local jungle myth about vines that sang to the Pretender.



🎲 Skill & Strategy Hooks

- Perception/Insight DC 13: Something feels wrong about the vines; they aren’t just decorative

- Nature/Medicine DC 15: The vines’ coloration suggests they’re digestive in function

- Stealth: Approaching the corpse quietly may delay vine activation (DC 14 group check)

- Fire or Radiant Magic: Disrupts vines’ aggression for 1 round

- Combat Options: Players may try to lead ravethings into the vines deliberately for a meat-vs-meat brawl

📜 SCROLL FRAGMENT — “The Hollow Song Remains”

This fragment is found rolled and preserved in a bone scroll-case on the armored corpse. The parchment is thin and ancient, water-stained but readable.  Scratched in blood and ink, shaky but deliberate. The parchment is brittle, with tears and stains. The final lines are smudged with dark fingerprints.

**The Fifth Mouth Never Closes**

“I see it now. The vines do not feed on flesh, but on voice. I am being unmade from the throat inward.”

“The temple does not sing. It listens. Always has.”

“I followed the breath beneath the stone. Heard the chant of the silent god.”

“The Fifth Mouth drank too deep. I am the last verse.”

“…and even now, I want to sing it. I want to give myself.”

“No. I will not.”

“I give this silence freely.”

🧠 PCs who have any naval or historical background may make a DC 13 History check to recall Dovain’s name or the tale of his disappearance.



⚔️ The Sword:

Name: Final Verse

Type: Short Sword (ritual-bladed, jagged, dark metal)

Stats (Uncommon Weapon)

- 1d6 piercing, finesse, light

- On a killing blow, the wielder hears a fragment of the dying creature’s last memory

- Once per long rest, may be plunged into one’s own flesh to resist possession or charm (take 1d6 damage to reroll a failed CHA or WIS save)

This is the sword Dovain used to silence the Hollow Song within himself.



⚓ The True Name of the Ship:

“The Fifth Mouth”

A name passed among a previous crew in whispers, never spoken aloud in port.

They believed the ship listened, that it was the fifth mouth of a forgotten sea god, and by sailing her they fed it stories and blood.



🗡 THE FINAL ACT OF DOVAIN

What Happened:

- Dovain became ensnared by the False Beauty Vines, but they fed slowly—keeping him weak and conscious, dissolving his muscles from the inside.

- Trapped, hallucinating, and partially fused to the roots of the skull, he retrieved a short, barbed blade from his belt and thrust it upward under his ribcage, into his own heart.

- The vines recoiled, rejecting the dead and unpalatable, and so his body remains, dried and draped in flowers.
