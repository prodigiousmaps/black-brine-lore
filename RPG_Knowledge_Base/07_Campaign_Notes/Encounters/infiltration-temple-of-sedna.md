# 🧭 Temple of Sedna Infiltration – GM Area Guide

*Level 6 adventure for Pinch, Franklin, and Sy – 2 to 3 hours*

---

## 🗺️ AREA 1: **Entrance Tunnel**

**Description**

Slippery, barnacle-covered steps descend into salt-choked air. The temple is quiet, but the deeper rooms hiss and breathe with the tide.

**Hazards**

- **Salt Scab Trap** – Pressure plate covered in salt crystals.

    - Trigger: Spike erupts (Dex Save DC 14 or 3d10 piercing + grappled).

- **Bioluminescent Barnacles** – Loud movement causes them to glow (Stealth Disadvantage for 1 minute).

**Clues**

- **Fresco on the wall**: A woman with a sewn mouth, three ritual bowls before her; only the **water-filled bowl is untouched** by eels.

- "*Her breath is not ours to keep.”*

**Creatures**

- None here, but area is **noisy** and echoes carry.

---

## 🗺️ AREA 2: **Sanctuary Chamber (Main Temple Hall)**

**Description**

A massive open space with a collapsed ceiling and a stagnant tidepool in the center. Mossy offerings rot in broken urns. Stone pews lie cracked and shifting.

**Hazards**

- **Tide Surge** – Random d4 each round. On a 1, a sudden rush of water:

    - Dex Save DC 15 or knocked prone/slid 10 ft.

- **Rot Lung Spores** – A patch of wet fungal growth near a broken altar.

    - Con Save DC 12 or poisoned for 1 hour (disadv. on swimming/breath checks).

**Creatures**

- **Brine Ghouls x3**

    - AC 13 | HP 36 | Amphibious

    - *Drown Grip*: Grapples; target begins drowning unless they can breathe water.

    - Weak to fire/radiant

**Clues**

- **Dead Acolyte corpse** with log fragment:

    > “Held my tongue… gave her breath… the mirror stopped screaming.”

- **Corpse’s mouth is coral-sealed.**

---

## 🗺️ AREA 3: **Verdant Channel Passage**

**Description**

A slick stone crawlway lined with algae and slow-dripping seawater. This area connects the sanctuary to the deeper temple.

**Hazards**

- **Tight crawl** – PCs must go one at a time. Dex (Acrobatics) DC 13 or fall into submerged salt basin.

- Optional bypass: flooded shaft to priest’s quarters requires **Swim check DC 14** or **Water Breathing**.

**Creatures**

- **Tide Leech Swarm** (reskinned rat swarm)

    - On hit: target loses 1d4 CON (returns after long rest)

    - Repelled by fire or radiant magic

    - Crawl into armor and mouths

---

## 🗺️ AREA 4: **Priest’s Quarters (Codex Room)**

**Description**

A circular room with ritual bowls, a black obsidian chest overgrown with coral, and a cracked mirror veiled in barnacles.

**Puzzle**

**The Codex of Salt and Shadow is sealed inside the chest.** See puzzle steps:

1. **Silence** for one round (any noise resets).

2. Pour **seawater into the water bowl**.

3. Speak aloud:

    > *“Her breath is not ours to keep.”*

**Failure Consequences**

- Wrong bowl: Salt spray (Con Save DC 13 or blinded 1 min)

- Speaking too soon: Chest locks for 10 mins

- Wrong phrase: Psychic backlash (Wis Save DC 14 or 3d6 psychic, whispers for 24 hrs)

- Forced entry: Trap triggers (6d8 thunder + lightning, Dex Save DC 15 half)

**Clues**

- **Mirror**: Reflects character with mouth sewn shut

- **Chest hums** when room is silent

- Journal fragment (see Area 2)

**Creatures**

- **Salted Eye** (Eye Horror, AC 17, HP 40)

    - *Whispers of the Deep*: Wis Save DC 14 or stunned 1 round

    - Weak to radiant/fire

    - Avoids direct combat, retreats into water if hurt

---

## 🗺️ AREA 5: **Escape Tunnel (Tide Rushing In)**
