# Encounter 4

Threat level = 

Day 2 - hex 1 - 3 miles in 6 hours

WEATHER

**Sudden Chill -** Jungle temperature drops. Each PC must succeed CON save DC 12 or lose 1 hour of travel to stiffness/frostbite.

**Mood**: The jungle canopy, thins beyond the thicket and the temperature drops

NAVIGATION CHECK - No check required, vexir is visible



NARRATIVE

As the party exits the thicket they are struck by a cold wind slaps you in the face.  The trees in this area are dead and fallen forming a maze of deadfalls and with no tree cover to insulate you, wind chills you to the bone.  The foothills begin to rise to the east and west and mount Vexir looms before you, snow capped and forbidding. a distant plume of ash rises from the peak and is scattered by the wind.  Beyond the fallen trees, miles distant, the jungle appears to resume, filling the valley with green and ascending the slope of the distant mountain.



**Treefall Maze** â€“ tangled wreckage of collapsed trees. Choose: 1 extra hour to climb or DC 14 Acrobatics to squeeze through.
â€‹

NARRATIVE

Part 2 - The trunks of hulking trees toppled randomly by some unseen force, cover the landscape.  Trunks thick as wagons lean this way and that creating a warren of walls, bridges and tunnels twisting in all directions.  Above it all is a chill gray sky and occasional glimpses for mount Vexir through breaks in the deadfall.
