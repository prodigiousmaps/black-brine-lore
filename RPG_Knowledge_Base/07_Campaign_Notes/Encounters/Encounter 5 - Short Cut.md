# Encounter 5 - Short Cut

They have made it through the maze and enter the jungle.  They will have 2 hexes to cover before the approach begins.
​
​Travel = 8 hours per hex
​Weather = Ash fall - dampened sound, half visibility - Mount Vexhir ejects ash into the sky and it settles like snow on the jungle below.

**Hex 1**

The ridge or the basin?

1. Ridge increases time by 2 hour - Bone field - skeletal remains are tied to trees and bone chimes hang from the branches by the thousands. -5 Stealth - If a Stealth check is failed they will encounter shaman

2. ​Basin decreases time by 2 hours - Razor ferns - PCs take 1d4 slashing damage if they try to pass quickly. Can be burned (draws attention).



Hex 2
