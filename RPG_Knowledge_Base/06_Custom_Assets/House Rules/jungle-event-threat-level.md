# Event Threat Level

## Event-Based Stealth Rolls
Characters roll Stealth when:
- Moving through predator territory or enemy camps.  
- Passing through noisy terrain (mud, streams, leaves).  
- Climbing/descending obstacles (trees, ruins).  
- Interacting with dense foliage/objects.  
- Killing an enemy where others may hear.  
- Resting in unsafe areas (camp setup).  

## Exceptions
- Using cleared paths (Strange Bonesâ€™ routes).  
- Traveling slowly at half speed (Advantage).  
- Remaining still in hiding (Passive Stealth applies).
