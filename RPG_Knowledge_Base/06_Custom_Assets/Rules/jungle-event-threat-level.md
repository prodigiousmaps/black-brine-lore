# Event Threat Level

### **Event-Based Stealth Rolls**

Characters must make a Stealth check when they:

- **Move through high-alert zones** (predator territory, near enemy camps, through dense hunting grounds).

- **Pass through foliage, water, or terrain that naturally makes noise** (crunching leaves, deep mud, running streams).

- **Climb or descend obstacles** (trees, cliffs, temple ruins) where movement might be noticed.

- **Interact with the jungle** (pushing through thick brush, dislodging vines, moving objects).

- **Kill an enemy** in an area where others might hear the struggle.

- **Rest in unsafe areas** (Stealth check for setting up camp silently).

üõë **Stealth Checks Are NOT Needed** when:

- Moving through **cleared paths** (already scouted by Strange Bones).

- Traveling **slowly and deliberately** (moving at half speed grants advantage).

- Already in **hiding and remaining still** (passive stealth applies instead).
