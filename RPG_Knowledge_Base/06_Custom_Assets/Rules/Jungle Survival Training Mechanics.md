# Jungle Survival Training Mechanics

### **Strange Bonesâ€™ Survival Training: "The Jungle Does Not Care About You"**

Before he lets the party step foot in the **forbidden western jungle**, Strange Bones **drills them in the only things that will keep them alive**. His methods are brutal, unpredictable, and **designed to break their bad habits** before the jungle does.

**"You wanna live? You gotta be quieter than the moss. Smarter than the snakes. You mess up in here? The jungle donâ€™t kill you quickâ€”it eats you slow."**

---

## **Phase 1: The Silence Test (Stealth & Alert Level Training)**

**Goal:** The party must navigate a **controlled jungle course** without **raising the alert level past 2**.

### **The Challenge**

- Strange Bones has **set up tripwires of woven vines, hanging bones, and scent markers** along a jungle trail.

- **The party must reach the end without alerting him**â€”or the **beasts heâ€™s hidden along the way**.

### **Stealth Training Rules**

- **Each player rolls a Stealth check** every time they move past an obstacle.

- If **more than half succeed**, they move forward.

- If **more than half fail**, Strange Bones increases the **Jungle Alert Level**.

- **At Alert Level 3, something hunts them.**

### **Obstacles** (d6 Random Hazards)

1. **Rotten Foliage Trap:** The ground is covered in **dry leaves & brittle branches** (Stealth DC 14).

2. **Low-Hanging Vines:** A **tripwire of vines** is stretched across a choke point (Stealth DC 13 or be entangled).

3. **Predatorâ€™s Trail:** The party must sneak past a **real jungle predator** that Strange Bones baited into the area (Stealth DC 15).

4. **Telling Scent:** A **wind shift** carries their scentâ€”unless they use **jungle herbs** to mask it (Survival DC 14).

5. **Resting Death Moths:** A cluster of **giant insects** rests in a tree. **Wake them, and they will swarm** (Stealth DC 16).

6. **Decoy Campfire:** Strange Bones sets up a **fake campfire with fresh coals**â€”a **trap for fools who donâ€™t check their surroundings**.

**Failure Consequences:**

- **A jungle beast is released.**

- **Strange Bones fires an arrow at them (non-lethal, but humiliating).**

- **They are forced to start over.**

ðŸ”¹ **Lesson Learned:** "The jungle listens. You move loud, it sends a killer after you."

---

## **Phase 2: The Vanishing Act (Passive Stealth & Scent Disguise)**

**Goal:** The party must remain **motionless and unseen** while Strange Bones **tracks them**.

### **The Challenge**

- The party is given **one minute** to **camouflage themselves using only natural materials**.

- After one minute, Strange Bones **hunts them.**

- He makes **a Passive Perception check (DC 15)** to detect them.

### **Ways to Improve Success**

- **Using mud, moss, or charcoal to blend in (+2 Stealth).**

- **Masking scent with jungle herbs (+2 against scent tracking).**

- **Remaining completely still (Stealth check at Advantage).**

- **Hiding behind a non-obvious barrier (DM discretion).**

### **Failure Consequences**

- If he **finds them**, he fires **an arrow near their head** and tells them they are **already dead**.

- If **two or more fail**, he **releases a jungle predator** to "chase the slowest."

- If **only one fails**, he humiliates them by **smearing animal dung on their face**:

    *"You stink of death anyway. Now at least you got a reason."*

ðŸ”¹ **Lesson Learned:** "It ain't just about being quiet. It's about disappearing."

---

## **Phase 3: The Hunger Clock (Survival & Foraging)**

**Goal:** The party must **find enough food & water for a day**â€”without **poisoning themselves or attracting predators**.

### **The Challenge**

- The party must **forage for supplies in the jungle**.

- **Each character makes a Survival check (DC 16)** to **find food & water safely**.

- **Failure means they risk poison, thirst, or drawing unwanted attention.**

### **Possible Outcomes**

1. **Success (16+)** â€“ They find **edible fruit, fresh water, or a hidden game trail.**

2. **Mixed Success (10â€“15)** â€“ They **get enough**, but:

    - The **water is tainted** (CON Save DC 13 vs. Jungle Sickness).

    - The food is **loud to gather**, increasing the **Jungle Alert Level**.

3. **Failure (<10)** â€“ They either **find nothing** or eat something **poisonous** (CON Save DC 15 vs. Paralysis).

4. **Critical Failure (Nat 1)** â€“ They **attract a predator** while searching.

ðŸ”¹ **Lesson Learned:** "You think the jungle feeds you? No. You take from it, it takes from you."

---

## **Phase 4: The Shadow Hunt (Stealth & Jungle Combat)**

**Goal:** The party must **ambush a moving target** without being detected.

### **The Challenge**

- Strange Bones sets up **a moving target (either an illusion, a puppet, or a real jungle beast).**

- The party must **strike it down with surprise** using **bows, thrown weapons, or magic**.

- **If they alert the target before hitting it, it flees or attacks.**

### **Stealth + Combat Rolls**

1. **Stealth Check (DC 14)** â€“ Stay hidden until the target is within range.

2. **Attack Roll** â€“ Must hit in **one shot**â€”**or the prey flees**.

3. **Success?** â€“ They kill cleanly.

4. **Failure?** â€“ They trigger an **actual jungle ambush**.

ðŸ”¹ **Lesson Learned:** "You get **one shot.** Waste it, and now you're the prey."

---

## **Phase 5: The Fire That Leaves No Trace (Camp & Resting)**

**Goal:** The party must set up **a camp that is invisible and silent.**

### **The Challenge**

- The party must **set up a campfire, resting area, and lookout system** without **alerting the jungle**.

- **They roll a Group Survival Check (DC 15).**

- **Failure?** Something **finds them in the night**.

### **Campfire Safety Rules**

- **Dig a fire pit, donâ€™t build a standing flame.**

- **Use only dry wood (no smoke).**

- **Extinguish embers completely (DC 13 to hide all traces).**

ðŸ”¹ **Lesson Learned:** "You light a fire **wrong**, and the jungle donâ€™t just see youâ€”it remembers you."

---

## **The Final Test: "Now Youâ€™re Ready to Die"**

- Strange Bones **blindfolds the party** and **drops them in the jungle at night.**

- They must **find their way back** using **everything he taught them**:

    - **Tracking safe paths.**

    - **Avoiding Whispering Fog.**

    - **Hiding from predators.**

    - **Foraging for food & water.**

- **Failure means they barely escape, exhausted and humiliated.**

- **Success means they are now jungle hunters, not prey.**

ðŸ’€ **Final Words from Strange Bones:**

*"You ainâ€™t safe. You ain't prepared. You just know a little more about how youâ€™re gonna die. Thatâ€™s enough."*
