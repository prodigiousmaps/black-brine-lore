# Navigation Events



Navigation Event Table (1d12)

| d12 | Navigation Event                                                                                                                     |
| :-- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Faint Footpath** – a long-abandoned trail appears. PCs may follow it (50/50 chance of speeding travel or leading into danger).     |
| 2   | **Treefall Maze** – tangled wreckage of collapsed trees. Choose: 1 extra hour to climb or DC 14 Acrobatics to squeeze through.       |
| 3   | **Confusing Sunlight** – light refracts strangely in the canopy. Disadvantage on Spot Mountain rolls for this hex.                   |
| 4   | **Animal Sign** – fresh predator scat or claw marks. Gives advantage on next Stealth check if they avoid the trail.                  |
| 5   | **Forked Stream** – an unexpected water branch. Choose: ford it (DC 13 Athletics) or detour 1 extra hex.                             |
| 6   | **False Peak** – a smaller mountain looms and confuses orientation. Spotting Vexir requires a DC 16 Perception roll.                 |
| 7   | **Fog Patch** – visibility drops to 10 feet. Party must move slowly or risk collision (DC 13 DEX save or minor injury).              |
| 8   | **Insect Swarm** – random PC must make a DC 14 CON save or suffer disadvantage on Perception for 4 hours.                            |
| 9   | **Echoing Sound** – an eerie sound repeats the party's last words. DC 13 Insight or Arcana to determine direction is still correct.  |
| 10  | **Canopy Opportunity** – unusually straight tree offers easier climb. DC 10 Athletics to get above canopy and spot Vexir.            |
| 11  | **Dead Zone** – nothing grows here. PCs may pass quickly (half time) but rest will not recover HP here.                              |
| 12  | **Stone Marker** – a weather-worn idol or pillar (Sedna or the Pretender). PCs may stop to investigate for clues or magical effects. |

Land Feature Table (1d12)

| d12 | Landmark / Terrain Feature                                                                                                                 |
| :-- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Razor Fern Basin** – PCs take 1d4 slashing damage if they try to pass quickly. Can be burned (draws attention).                          |
| 2   | **Fungal Mound** – huge rotting spore dome. Investigate for clues (Arcana/Nature) or give it a wide berth (+1 travel hour).                |
| 3   | **Vine-choked Ravine** – climb (DC 13 Athletics) or walk a winding route down and up (+1 hour).                                            |
| 4   | **Hollow Tree Sentinel** – massive tree with a crawlable interior. Party can rest inside (advantage on Stealth), but risk dream encounter. |
| 5   | **Sunken Shrine** – flooded with roots. Religious PCs may interact for insight or dread.                                                   |
| 6   | **Bone Field** – dozens of skeletons, clean-picked and piled intentionally. Passing through risks attracting a hunter.                     |
| 7   | **Swallow Bog** – terrain counts as difficult and PCs risk becoming stuck (DC 12 STR save per PC).                                         |
| 8   | **Spider Bridge** – webs connect trees over a deep ravine. Acrobatics DC 15 to cross. Fire or blades will collapse it.                     |
| 9   | **Cursed Spring** – drink to restore 1 HP and gain a hallucination or vision (DM’s choice).                                                |
| 10  | **Obsidian Shardfall** – black glass shards scatter a hillside. Climb DC 14 or take 1d6 piercing per failed attempt.                       |
| 11  | **Singing Stones** – natural rock formation emits strange tone. Investigation may offer temple clue or mild psychic damage.                |
| 12  | **Whispering Canopy** – wind flows just right to create voices in the leaves. Insight DC 13 to parse a message (real or imagined).         |

## DM NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

- Combine both rolls into one narrative moment:

    *“You crest a ridge where the trees thin out briefly. To the east, a long-dead trail snakes downward into a basin of thick razor ferns. Something once passed this way—but not recently.”*

- Give the **player with the best thematic skill** a moment to shine each hex—Pinch (mapping), Sy (tracking), Franklin (interpretation), Andromeda (reading nature), etc.

- You can **pre-roll a few hexes** ahead for smoother pacing if desired.
