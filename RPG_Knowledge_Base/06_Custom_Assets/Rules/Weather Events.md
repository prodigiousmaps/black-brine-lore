# Weather Events

| d20 | Weather Event              | Effects on Travel, Danger, and Rest                                                                                               |    |    |
| :-- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :- | :- |
| 1   | **Blistering Sun**         | Travel speed -½ hex. PCs in light armor roll CON save DC 12 or gain 1 Exhaustion.                                                 |    |    |
| 2   | **Suffocating Humidity**   | Disadvantage on Stealth checks and any Wisdom (Survival) check due to discomfort.                                                 |    |    |
| 3   | **Torrential Rain**        | Visibility reduced to 20 ft. Spotting Vexir is impossible. All terrain counts as difficult.                                       |    |    |
| 4   | **Thunderstorm**           | Forbids climbing trees or lighting torches. CON save DC 14 or suffer 1 level Exhaustion if caught out.                            |    |    |
| 5   | **Dense Jungle Fog**       | Disadvantage on ranged attacks and Perception. Encounter chance increased by +1.                                                  |    |    |
| 6   | **Sweltering Winds**       | No mechanical penalty, but all scent-based tracking is impossible.                                                                |    |    |
| 7   | **Nightfall at Noon**      | Magical darkness settles. Day encounters become night-themed. Undead +1 to stealth and surprise.                                  |    |    |
| 8   | **Monsoon Surge**          | River hexes rise dramatically. Water travel is fast (double hexes), but requires DC 15 Navigation or capsize.                     |    |    |
| 9   | **Blood Mist**             | Vision tint. All healing magic heals 1d4 less. Animals act erratically.                                                           |    |    |
| 10  | **Echo Storm**             | Thunder echoes unnaturally. Speech echoes for 1d4 rounds, interfering with stealth.                                               |    |    |
| 11  | **Jungle Silence**         | No insects, birds, or rustling. PCs gain advantage on Stealth, but encounter DC lowered (higher risk).                            |    |    |
| 12  | **Ash Rain**               | Black flecks fall like snow. PCs may rest safely, but all flame and radiant magic functions at half power.                        |    |    |
| 13  | **Hollow Drizzle**         | Constant, whispering rain. PCs must save vs Sleep during watches (WIS DC 13).                                                     |    |    |
| 14  | **Droning Heat**           | Buzzy noise causes Disadvantage on INT checks. Every long rest requires CON save DC 13 or gain Fatigue.                           |    |    |
| 15  | **Wailing Wind**           | Sounds carry in strange ways. Roll twice on Encounter table, take higher threat result.                                           |    |    |
| 16  | **Siren Rain**             | Rain hums like distant flutes. DC 13 CHA save or PCs are drawn to wander during camp.                                             |    |    |
| 17  | **Still Day**              | Nothing moves. No encounters unless deliberately triggered—but map tools don’t function.                                          |    |    |
| 18  | **Crimson Twilight**       | Red sun filters through. All undead gain +1 to attack. Divine spells have Disadvantage unless Sedna is invoked.                   |    |    |
| 19  | **Sudden Chill**           | Jungle temperature drops. Each PC must succeed CON save DC 12 or lose 1 hour of travel to stiffness/frostbite.                    |    |    |
| 20  | **The Hollow Song Begins** | Each PC hears a piece of a song they recognize. From now on, no PC may benefit from Help actions until they complete a long rest. |    |    |
|     |                            |                                                                                                                                   |    |    |

| Condition                       | Travel Impact                                                     |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heavy Rain, Mud, Fog            | Travel speed reduced by ½ hex                                     |
| Torrential Storm, Flash Flood   | Roll Navigation or be forced to wait out the event (lose 1 Watch) |
| Magical or Supernatural Weather | Effects persist into combat, rest, and even spellcasting          |

## NAVIGATION EFFECTS

- **Poor Visibility**: Increases chance of becoming lost unless Vexir is visible.

- **Sound-Altering Weather**: Increases encounter chance, decreases party Stealth effectiveness.

- **Illusory Weather (Sedna’s Influence)**: May trick the party into believing they’ve looped or “escaped” when they’ve gone deeper.
