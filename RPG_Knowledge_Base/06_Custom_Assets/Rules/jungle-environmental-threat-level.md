# Environmental Threat Level

### **Enemy or Environmental Threat Stealth Checks**

- **Approaching a hostile creature, predator, or patrol** (Passive Perception vs. Stealth check).

- **Crossing an open space** (when there’s no immediate cover).

- **Evading the Whispering Fog** (if their **Jungle Alert Level** is high, they must roll **disadvantage**).

- **Using fire or magic** (fire and bright light increase the need for stealth checks, unless precautions are taken).
