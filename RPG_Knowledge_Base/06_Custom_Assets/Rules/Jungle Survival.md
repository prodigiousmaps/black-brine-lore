# Jungle Survival

## **1. Jungle Stealth & Detection Mechanics**

### **Jungle Alert Level (Dynamic Threat System)**

The jungle is filled with **predators, hidden sentinels, and supernatural forces**. Use an **escalating threat level** that increases as the party makes mistakes:

- **Level 0**: Unseen – The jungle is unaware of them.

- **Level 1**: Signs of disturbance – Something is watching.

- **Level 2**: Hunters have been dispatched – Predators or patrols are tracking them.

- **Level 3**: The jungle **calls** – They are hunted by something **they cannot escape**.

**How It Works:**

- **Every noise, fire, or broken branch** increases the Alert Level.

- **Failing stealth checks, killing loudly, or staying in one place too long** also raises it.

- **Critical failures in survival, tracking, or resting** increase the level dramatically.

- **Only extreme caution, erasing tracks, or supernatural means** can lower it.

Once **Level 3 is reached**, they trigger an **inescapable jungle horror event**—something terrible finds them.

## **2. The Jungle Itself is a Living Force**

### **The Whispering Fog (Madness Mechanic)**

At night, the jungle fog **whispers names, memories, and promises**. Those who listen too closely **do not return the same**.

**When exposed to the fog, players must make a WIS Save (DC 14 + Alert Level):**

- **Success:** They resist the whispers but feel uneasy.

- **Failure:** They gain one level of **Jungle Madness** (similar to exhaustion).

- **Critical Failure (Nat 1):** They hear **something else**—a forgotten name or command. Roll on a custom **Horrors of the Fog Table** (see below).

**Jungle Madness Table (Each Failed Save)**

1. **Mild Unease** – Disadvantage on Perception checks until next long rest.

2. **Auditory Hallucinations** – They hear voices calling their name in the distance.

3. **Disorientation** – They lose sense of direction and must succeed on a Survival (DC 15) check to navigate.

4. **Paranoia** – They suspect a party member is *not who they claim to be*.

5. **Possession Attempt** – A shadow in the fog tries to **enter their mind** (CHA Save DC 15 or lose control for 1d4 rounds).

6. **Total Panic** – They must run in a random direction for 2d6 minutes.

**How to Cure Jungle Madness**

- A **full 8-hour rest** in **absolute safety**.

- A **restoration spell** (Lesser Restoration cures one level, Greater cures all).

- A ritual using jungle herbs and blood sacrifice.

## **3. Navigation is Never Guaranteed**

### **Twisting Jungle Paths (Random Navigation Rolls)**

The jungle **does not want them to leave**. Even skilled rangers struggle here.

Every **4 hours of travel**, the party must roll a **Navigation Check**:

- **Success (Survival DC 14+)** – They stay on course.

- **Failure (DC <14)** – They drift off-course into an **Unknown Hazard**.

- **Critical Failure (Nat 1)** – They are utterly lost **(add +1 to the Alert Level and trigger a jungle event).**

**Unknown Hazards Table (Roll d8)**

1. **Quicksand Pit** – Escape DC 15 Athletics or become restrained.

2. **Carnivorous Vines** – Attacks with +5 to hit, 2d6 poison damage, and grapples.

3. **Hallucinogenic Spores** – Inhaled CON Save DC 15 or suffer **Jungle Madness** effects.

4. **Ancient Ruins** – A forgotten temple, possibly cursed or guarded.

5. **Hostile Tracker Encounter** – A jungle predator **or something worse** finds them.

6. **Blood-Leeching Swarm** – CON Save DC 13 or gain one level of **exhaustion**.

7. **Echoes of the Dead** – Phantom figures appear, leading the party astray.

8. **The Fog Draws Close** – Everyone makes a **Whispering Fog Save**.

**Modifications for Survival:**

- Strange Bones will **mark safe paths**, giving them **advantage on the first navigation check** each day.

- **Leaving behind magical marks or breadcrumbs?** The jungle might *erase them*.

## **4. The Unnatural Presence**

### **The Jungle Hears (Passive Perception System)**

The jungle has its own **Passive Perception (15)**.

- If the party makes **loud noise**, a **Stealth Check below 15** means **something notices**.

- If they **fail three stealth checks in a row**, **roll on the Jungle Hunter Encounter Table**.

**Jungle Hunters (Roll d6)**

1. **Stalking Shadowbeast** – A massive, unseen predator follows, striking when they are weakest.

2. **Lost Souls of the Fog** – Shamblers that whisper **regrets and lies**.

3. **Skin Thieves** – Jungle spirits that **replace** those who stray too far from camp.

4. **Flesh-Mimic Blossoms** – A plant that imitates **lost friends**, leading them into a trap.

5. **The Leech King’s Servants** – Jungle ghouls that feed on warmth.

6. **The Thing That Crawls** – A creature whose **eyes blink in different places** at different times.

## **5. Food, Water, and Exhaustion are Constant Threats**

### **The Hunger Clock**

The jungle **drains the body faster than normal lands**.

- Water **must be purified**, or CON Save DC 13 or gain **Jungle Sickness** (disadvantage on STR checks).

- Every **long rest**, players must eat rations **or take one level of exhaustion**.

- **Foraging (Survival DC 16)** can provide food **but risks attracting predators**.

---

## **Final Rule: Never Answer the Voices**

If a player **answers a voice calling their name**, the jungle **remembers them**.

- **Their name is now known** to the **Whispering Fog**, making them a **permanent target**.

- They **roll with disadvantage** against **fog-related events** for the rest of the campaign.

- There is **one way to erase their name**—but it involves a **blood sacrifice to Sedna**.
