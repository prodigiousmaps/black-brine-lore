# Passive Threat Level

### **Time-Based Stealth Checks**

- **Every 30–60 minutes** (real-world time) OR after **significant travel** (e.g., entering a new biome, crossing a river, passing a predator's lair).

- **During major weather shifts** (rain might grant advantage by muffling sounds, while dry seasons make everything crunchier).

- **After a combat encounter** (to see if something else has been alerted).

### **Advantage or Disadvantage Modifiers**
