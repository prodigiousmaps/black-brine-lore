# Stealth Preparation

## **1. Gear Modifications for Maximum Stealth**

Strange Bones will **strip down and alter** their gear to minimize noise and visibility.

### **ðŸ”¹ Clothing & Armor Adjustments**

âœ… **Muted Colors & Camouflage**:

- **Dye bright fabrics** using jungle **moss, crushed berries, or charcoal.**

- Use **mud smearing & leafy coverings** to blend into the jungle.

âœ… **Silence Metal Armor & Weapons**:

- **No chainmail or plate armor**â€”switch to **leather, padded armor, or cloth wrappings**.

- **Wrap all buckles, weapons, and tools** in cloth, soft leather, or vine bindings to **prevent clanking.**

- **Padded footwear** (softened leather or jungle moss insoles) to **reduce footstep noise.**

âœ… **Secure All Loose Gear**:

- **Tightly wrap** rations, water skins, and supplies in **waxed cloth** to prevent rattling.

- **No metal flasks or clinking potion bottles**â€”switch to **gourd containers**.

- **Weapons strapped in place** with leather ties to avoid shifting in combat.

âœ… **Darkened & Matte-Finished Weapons**:

- **Dull all reflective surfaces** with **ash, dirt, or charcoal paint.**

- **Metal blades coated in blackened oil or tar** to prevent light reflections.

âœ… **Dagger & Bow Over Heavy Gear**:

- **Prefer ranged weapons** like bows, crossbows, or throwing daggers over **clunky firearms or loud melee weapons.**

- **Use jungle-friendly weapons** (wooden clubs, bone knives) that blend into the environment.

## **2. Scent Masking & Suppression**

Predators **smell before they see**, and the jungle **remembers foreign scents.**

### **ðŸ”¹ Jungle Scent Techniques**

âœ… **Herbal Scent Masking**:

- Rub body with **crushed jungle herbs, moss, or natural oils**.

- Use **damp earth & charcoal dusting** to **eliminate unnatural scents.**

âœ… **Avoid Perfumed Items & Smoke**:

- No **perfume, strong soap, or scented oils**.

- **Smoke clings to clothing**â€”extinguish fires properly **without getting covered in soot.**

âœ… **Animal Blood Camouflage (Extreme Measure)**:

- Smearing **local animal blood** on armor or clothes can **mask human scent** from trackers.

---

## **3. Movement & Travel Precautions**

Strange Bones **forces the party to practice moving in near silence** before they enter the jungle.

### **ðŸ”¹ Tactical Movement Adjustments**

âœ… **Move Slowly & Carefully**:

- **Travel at half speed** to gain **advantage on Stealth checks**.

- **Avoid dry leaves, twigs, or loose soil**â€”step on moss, damp earth, or solid rock.

âœ… **Silent Communication**:

- Use **hand signals** instead of whispering.

- Establish a **simple code of gestures** for quick, quiet coordination.

âœ… **Stick to Cover & Shadows**:

- **Hug tree trunks & foliage** instead of open pathways.

- Move **between dense underbrush** to stay out of sight.

âœ… **Use Wind & Rain to Cover Noise**:

- **Plan movement during wind gusts** to mask footsteps.

- **Use rain to drown out sound**, making it safer to move quickly.

---

## **4. Campsite Stealth & Fire Discipline**

Resting **incorrectly** in the jungle **draws death**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Safe Camping Procedures**

âœ… **Fireless Cooking & Hidden Resting Spots**:

- **No open flames**â€”use **hot stones or embers** buried underground for heat.

- Camp **inside dense vegetation or between fallen trees**.

- Build shelter using **natural debris**, not artificial tents.

âœ… **Minimal Scent & Waste**:

- **Scatter food scraps far away** from camp.

- **No urination or waste near camp**â€”bury all traces.

âœ… **Decoy Fires & Dummy Camps** (for high-risk areas):

- **Set up false campsites** to mislead pursuers.

- Place **small campfire remnants** somewhere distant from the real resting area.

---

## **5. Weapon & Combat Readiness for Silent Kills**

If combat **must** happen, it **must be silent and final**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Silent Kill Tactics**

âœ… **Prioritize Ambush & First Strike**:

- Always **attack from stealth** to **gain surprise** (extra attack round).

- **Disable spellcasters & loud enemies first** before they can raise alarms.

âœ… **Use Blades & Bows Over Guns**:

- **Silent takedowns** (daggers, garrotes, arrows) prevent noise-based detection.

- If using a firearm, **fire from cover, then relocate immediately**.

âœ… **Hit & Run Combat Style**:

- **Strike quickly, then vanish into the jungle.**

- Avoid **long, drawn-out fights**â€”**every second is a chance for others to hear.**

âœ… **Jungle Noise Manipulation**:

- **Throw objects or disturb the foliage** in a different direction to **mislead pursuers.**

- **Mimic jungle sounds** to confuse trackers (using bird calls or rustling leaves).

## **6. Psychological Warfare Against the Jungleâ€™s Hunters**

Some creatures **do not track by sight alone**. The jungle **plays with the mind**â€”the best defense is preparation.

### **ðŸ”¹ Mental Fortitude & Countermeasures**

âœ… **Never Respond to the Whispering Fog**:

- If the jungle calls your name, **do not answer**.

- If voices whisper in the distance, **ignore them completely**.

âœ… **Travel With Fire, But Donâ€™t Use It Openly**:

- **Predators fear fire**, but using it carelessly **draws unwanted attention**.

- **Fire should be a last resort**, not a regular tool.

âœ… **Mark Safe Paths, But Subtly**:

- Use **hidden markers** (knots in vines, stacked stones) instead of obvious carvings.

- If using chalk or symbols, **make sure they can be erased easily.**

âœ… **Do Not Stray from the Group**:

- Those who **walk alone in the western jungle do not return.**

## **Final Checklist Before Entering the Jungle**

âœ… **Armor & gear wrapped in cloth for silence.**

âœ… **Clothing camouflaged with mud & plant dyes.**

âœ… **Weapons & tools secured against clinking.**

âœ… **Scent masked with herbs, charcoal, and blood.**

âœ… **Hand signals established for communication.**

âœ… **Fire preparation without leaving a trace.**

âœ… **Survival supplies packed without rattling.**

âœ… **Final warning: The jungle watches. Do not leave tracks.**
