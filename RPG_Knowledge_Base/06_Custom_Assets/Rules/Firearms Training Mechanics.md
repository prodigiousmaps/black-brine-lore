# Firearms Training Mechanics

### **Fenrithâ€™s Firearms Training Mini-Game: "The Black Powder Crucible"**

Fenrith doesnâ€™t train amateursâ€”he **breaks them down and rebuilds them** into **disciplined gunners**. His training is **grueling**, focusing on **speed, precision, and nerves of steel** in high-pressure combat.

The mini-game has **three phases** to simulate real firearms use:

1. **Loading Under Fire (Speed & Stress)**

2. **Marksmanship (Accuracy & Control)**

3. **Misfires & Malfunctions (Risk Management)**

Each phase uses **checks, modifiers, and risks** to make every shot feel **deliberate and dangerous**.

---

## **Phase 1: "Loading Under Fire" (Speed & Stress)**

ðŸ”¥ **Goal:** Successfully **load and fire** a musket or flintlock pistol **before an advancing enemy reaches you.**

**Game Mechanic:**

- Firearms have a **Loading Time**, requiring a Dexterity (or Sleight of Hand) check.

- The **enemy advances every round** while the shooter tries to reload **before they are within melee range**.

### **Loading Difficulty Table**

| **Weapon** | **Loading DC (Base)** | **Modifiers**                                |
| :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Musket** | DC 14 (2 rounds)      | -1 DC if using pre-measured powder           |
| **Pistol** | DC 12 (1 round)       | +2 DC if under duress (enemy within 10 feet) |

### **How It Works:**

1. **Each round, the shooter rolls a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check** to **reload the weapon.**

2. **Failure:** The enemy **closes the distance**, and the shooter must reload again **next round**.

3. **Success:** The weapon is loaded, and the shooter **can fire next turn**.

ðŸ’€ **If the enemy reaches melee before they fire, they must either:**

- **Make a Strength Check (DC 15) to push them back.**

- **Draw a melee weapon (losing their next turn).**

- **Attempt a risky point-blank shot (disadvantage).**

ðŸ›  **Trainee Perks:** After training with Fenrith, shooters gain:

âœ… **+2 on loading rolls under pressure.**

âœ… **Advantage when using pre-measured powder charges.**

---

## **Phase 2: "The Iron Eye" (Marksmanship & Control)**

ðŸ”¥ **Goal:** Hit **three moving targets** at different distances **before time runs out.**

**Game Mechanic:**

- Shooters must roll **attack rolls** against three targets at varying distances.

- Each target has a **unique AC** depending on **distance and movement.**

- The shooter **must choose** whether to spend extra time aiming (**bonus to hit**) or fire quickly (**risk a miss, but reload faster**).

### **Marksmanship Table**

| **Target Type**              | **Distance** | **AC (Musket)** | **AC (Pistol)** | **Modifiers**                            |
| :--------------------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Stationary (Dummy)**       | 30 ft        | 10              | 12              | +2 if aiming carefully (skip next round) |
| **Walking (Slow Moving)**    | 50 ft        | 12              | 15              | -2 if firing quickly                     |
| **Running (Dashing Target)** | 70 ft        | 15              | 18              | -5 unless spending a full round aiming   |

### **How It Works:**

1. **Shooter picks a target and fires.**

2. **They roll an attack using Dexterity + Proficiency** with firearms.

3. **If they hit, they move to the next target**.

4. **If they miss, they must choose:**

    - **Spend extra time re-aiming** (losing a round but getting a +3 bonus).

    - **Take the next shot immediately** (no bonus, but stay on schedule).

ðŸ›  **Trainee Perks:** After training with Fenrith, shooters gain:

âœ… **+1 to ranged attacks with firearms.**

âœ… **Advantage on one attack per long rest (representing refined accuracy).**

## **Phase 3: "Firearms Are Liars" (Misfires & Malfunctions)**

ðŸ”¥ **Goal:** Learn to **manage gun malfunctions** without panicking.

**Game Mechanic:**

- Each shot has a **chance to misfire**, especially in **bad weather or under stress.**

- If a misfire occurs, the shooter must **fix the weapon before they can fire again.**

### **Misfire Table**

| **Weapon** | **Misfire on** | **Fixing the Issue**                            |
| :--------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Musket** | Natural 1 or 2 | Action: DC 15 Tinkerâ€™s Tools or STR check       |
| **Pistol** | Natural 1      | Bonus Action: DC 12 Tinkerâ€™s Tools or STR check |

### **How It Works:**

1. **On a natural 1 (or 2 for muskets), the weapon misfires.**

2. The shooter must roll a **Dexterity (Tinkerâ€™s Tools) or Strength check** to **clear the jam.**

3. **Failure:** The weapon remains jammed **until next turn.**

4. **Critical Failure (Nat 1 on Fix Attempt):** The firearm is **out of commission for the fight**.

ðŸ”¥ **Weather Modifiers**

- **Heavy Rain:** Misfires on **1-3** instead of just 1-2.

- **Humid Jungle Conditions:** Misfires on **1-4** unless powder is stored correctly.

ðŸ›  **Trainee Perks:** After training with Fenrith, shooters gain:

âœ… **+1 to clearing misfires.**

âœ… **Once per day, they can automatically clear a misfire as a free action.**

---

## **Final Test: "The Gauntlet" (Combining All Phases)**

ðŸ”¥ **Goal:** Fire **three shots at moving targets while under fire**, avoiding misfires and completing the drill **before the enemy reaches them.**

**How It Works:**

1. **Roll to load** â†’ **If success, fire. If fail, enemy gets closer.**

2. **Roll to hit** â†’ **Choose between careful or fast shooting.**

3. **Roll for misfire** â†’ **Fix or adapt to the malfunction.**

ðŸŽ¯ **Scoring:**

- **Perfect:** 3/3 hits, no misfires, never let the enemy reach them.

- **Good:** 2/3 hits, minimal issues.

- **Mediocre:** 1/3 hits, or forced into melee.

- **Failure:** No hits, jammed gun, or tackled before firing.

ðŸ›  **Final Trainee Perks:**

- **Fenrithâ€™s Drills:** Once per long rest, shooter can **reload instantly (no roll required).**

- **Nerves of Steel:** If a misfire happens, they **donâ€™t panic and can still take another action.**

---

### **Fenrithâ€™s Final Words**

*"Firearms ain't for the weak-hearted. The musket donâ€™t care if youâ€™re scared. The pistol donâ€™t care if youâ€™re slow. You get one shotâ€”make it count. Or someone else will."*
