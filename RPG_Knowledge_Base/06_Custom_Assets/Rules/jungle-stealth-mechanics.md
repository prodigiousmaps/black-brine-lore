# Jungle Stealth Mechanics

### **When to Roll Stealth Checks in the Jungle**

Stealth checks should not be rolled **every step of the way**‚Äîinstead, they should be prompted by **specific events, environmental conditions, and enemy presence**. The key is to **balance tension without exhausting the players** with constant rolls.

Here‚Äôs how to determine when **stealth rolls** are required:

---

### **1. Event-Based Stealth Rolls**

Characters must make a Stealth check when they:

- **Move through high-alert zones** (predator territory, near enemy camps, through dense hunting grounds).

- **Pass through foliage, water, or terrain that naturally makes noise** (crunching leaves, deep mud, running streams).

- **Climb or descend obstacles** (trees, cliffs, temple ruins) where movement might be noticed.

- **Interact with the jungle** (pushing through thick brush, dislodging vines, moving objects).

- **Kill an enemy** in an area where others might hear the struggle.

- **Rest in unsafe areas** (Stealth check for setting up camp silently).

üõë **Stealth Checks Are NOT Needed** when:

- Moving through **cleared paths** (already scouted by Strange Bones).

- Traveling **slowly and deliberately** (moving at half speed grants advantage).

- Already in **hiding and remaining still** (passive stealth applies instead).

---

### **2. Time-Based Stealth Checks**

- **Every 30‚Äì60 minutes** (real-world time) OR after **significant travel** (e.g., entering a new biome, crossing a river, passing a predator's lair).

- **During major weather shifts** (rain might grant advantage by muffling sounds, while dry seasons make everything crunchier).

- **After a combat encounter** (to see if something else has been alerted).

---

### **3. Enemy or Environmental Threat Stealth Checks**

- **Approaching a hostile creature, predator, or patrol** (Passive Perception vs. Stealth check).

- **Crossing an open space** (when there‚Äôs no immediate cover).

- **Evading the Whispering Fog** (if their **Jungle Alert Level** is high, they must roll **disadvantage**).

- **Using fire or magic** (fire and bright light increase the need for stealth checks, unless precautions are taken).

---

## **Impact of Preparedness on Stealth Checks**

Strange Bones will make sure they **modify their gear and tactics** to boost their chances of success. Here‚Äôs how their **preparedness impacts their ability to succeed**:

### **1. Advantage or Disadvantage Modifiers**

| **Preparedness Level**                           | **Stealth Check Effect**         |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Moving slowly (half speed)**                   | **Advantage** on Stealth         |
| **Wrapped gear (no clanking metal)**             | **Advantage**                    |
| **Blending clothing (camouflage, jungle tones)** | **+2 bonus**                     |
| **Barefoot at night / treated boots**            | **+1 bonus**                     |
| **Masking scent (charcoal, jungle herbs)**       | **Cancels scent-based tracking** |
| **No metal armor (only leathers or cloth)**      | **+2 bonus**                     |
| **Using natural cover (dense foliage, trees)**   | **+5 to Passive Stealth**        |
| **Moving in the rain or wind**                   | **Advantage** (noise masking)    |
| **Hunting predators know they're there**         | **Disadvantage**                 |
| **Traveling fast or in a group**                 | **Disadvantage**                 |
| **Carrying fire or wearing strong scents**       | **Disadvantage**                 |

### **2. Passive Stealth (Not Rolling)**

If the players are **extremely careful** and **move as Strange Bones taught them**, they don‚Äôt always need to roll.

Instead, the jungle has a **Passive Perception (15-18)** for **predators, patrols, and unnatural forces**.

- If their **Passive Stealth (10 + Stealth Modifiers)** **meets or beats the enemy‚Äôs Passive Perception**, **they stay hidden** without rolling.

- If their **Passive Stealth is lower**, **they must roll an active Stealth check** to avoid detection.

---

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Nighttime Camp Setup**

- The party sets up camp and **muffles their gear, extinguishes fire early, and places no-scent markers.**

- **Passive Stealth applies** (using their prep bonuses). If **they meet or exceed 15**, they are safe. If **they are below 15**, they must roll Stealth checks.

- **Failure?** Something sniffs at the edge of camp.

### **Scenario 2: Crossing a Predator‚Äôs Territory**

- The party **moves at full speed** (disadvantage on stealth).

- They **step on dry leaves** (Stealth DC 14 check).

- If **one person fails**, the jungle **Alert Level increases** and something begins **tracking them**.

### **Scenario 3: Evading a Jungle Patrol**

- They use **camouflage, cover, and slow movement** (+5 to Passive Stealth).

- Their **Passive Stealth = 17** while the enemy‚Äôs **Passive Perception = 16** ‚Üí **They avoid detection without rolling**.

- If one person **makes a mistake (e.g., sneezing, knocking into a tree)**, they must roll a **Stealth check to avoid notice**.

---

### **Individual vs. Group Stealth Checks in the Jungle**

The best approach depends on the **situation and tension level**. Here‚Äôs when to use **group stealth checks** vs. **individual rolls**, along with modifications to balance the challenge.

---

### **1. Group Stealth Check (Majority Success)**

A **group stealth check** works well when the party is moving together, assuming **they are equally prepared and careful**.

- **Everyone rolls Stealth.**

- If **at least half** the group **succeeds**, the party stays hidden.

- If **more than half fail**, they make **some noise**, increasing the **Jungle Alert Level** or triggering **consequences**.

‚úÖ **When to Use a Group Check:**

- **General movement** through jungle terrain.

- **Approaching an enemy camp or danger zone.**

- **Crossing an open space with some cover.**

- **Resting in a concealed location.**

üìå **Modifications to Make Group Stealth Feel Fair:**

- If **one player has expertise in Stealth**, they can **lead the group**, allowing **one re-roll** per failure.

- **If one person rolls a Nat 1**, something **notices them**, but the whole party doesn‚Äôt necessarily suffer‚Äîmaybe a predator starts tracking them **rather than attacking outright**.

---

### **2. Individual Stealth Checks (High-Stakes Situations)**

Everyone rolls **separately**, and **individual failures have immediate consequences**.

- **If a single person fails, they are noticed**, but the **rest of the group may not be**.

- Players **who fail might get a chance to recover** (e.g., making a quick Deception check to act natural or using an action to "freeze" in place).

‚ùå **When Individual Stealth is Required:**

- **Infiltrating a guarded area (like ruins or enemy camps).**

- **Moving through a tight space where each movement matters.**

- **Escaping an enemy when split up.**

- **Sneaking past an unnatural jungle horror** (because its attention may be drawn to one, not all).

üìå **Modifications for Individual Checks:**

- If **one person fails**, they aren‚Äôt instantly doomed. Instead:

    - A **tracking enemy hears them but doesn‚Äôt strike yet**.

    - A **creature is aware but doesn‚Äôt see them** (they must roll again or stay perfectly still).

    - The **group gets a warning**‚Äîa signal to stop and re-adjust before it‚Äôs too late.

---

### **3. Assisted Stealth Rolls (Covering for Each Other)**

For **situations where some players are naturally stealthier than others**, allow **stealthy characters to assist clumsier ones**.

üõ† **Ways to Balance This:**

- **Stealth Leader Bonus:** If one person rolls **20+**, they can **cover for one failure** (like distracting an enemy or helping another hide).

- **Disadvantage Reduction:** A stealthy character can **guide another**, allowing a **clumsy character to roll normally instead of at disadvantage**.

- **Tethered Movement:** If everyone is **moving together and holding onto each other**, only the **leader** rolls (like a conga line through the shadows).

---

### **4. The "Stealth Chain" Mechanic (Progressive Group Success)**

Instead of one **binary check**, you can make stealth **a progressive challenge**.

üìå **How It Works:**

- Each **successful Stealth check** moves the group **one step closer** to a **safe zone** (like an enemy camp or clearing).

- Each **failure** adds a **penalty**, like raising the **Jungle Alert Level** or forcing a **harder next roll**.

- If the **party accumulates three failures**, **something finds them**.

ü¶é **Example: Sneaking Past a Patrol**

1. **First roll:** Success! The group moves closer.

2. **Second roll:** One failure. The **enemy turns toward their location**.

3. **Third roll:** Success! The group freezes and avoids detection.

4. **Final roll:** Nat 1. A **branch snaps**‚Äîsomething **starts investigating**.

This makes sneaking **tense but fair**‚Äîeven one mistake doesn‚Äôt **instantly doom the party**, but too many will **draw attention**.

---

### **Summary: Which System to Use?**

‚úÖ **Group Stealth (Majority Rule)**

- Works for **general movement** in the jungle.

- **At least half succeed?** Party stays hidden.

- **More than half fail?** They alert something.

‚úÖ **Individual Stealth (High Stakes)**

- Used for **tight, dangerous moments**.

- One failure **might** not mean total disaster‚Äîbut it draws attention.

‚úÖ **Assisted Stealth (Helping Clumsy Players)**

- Stealth experts **help weaker ones** to improve odds.

- One high roll can **cover for a single failure**.

‚úÖ **Stealth Chain (Progressive Success)**

- The group **must succeed multiple times** to stay hidden.

- **3 failures in total?** Something **hunts them down**.

---

### **Final Thought: The Jungle Isn‚Äôt Just Pass/Fail**

Make **stealth mistakes feel like tension-building moments** rather than instant combat:

- A **predator follows them instead of attacking immediately**.

- A **watcher spots movement but doesn‚Äôt know what it is yet**.

- A **low roll means something heard them, but they can still hide**.

This way, **even failures feel like part of the jungle‚Äôs creeping dread**‚Äîrather than just a switch flipping from "hidden" to "discovered."
