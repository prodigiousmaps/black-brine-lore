# Navigating the Mists of Sedna

### **Navigating the Mist and Reefs (Skill Challenge)**

#### **Setup**

- The **Coin** provides guidance, but the **mist and reefs require careful maneuvering**.

- The **ship has a crew**, but the players must take **active roles** to ensure safe passage.

- This is a **complex challenge**, requiring **multiple successful checks** before accumulating **3 failures**.

- If they **fail 3 times**, they **crash into a reef**, suffer ship damage, or encounter an unforeseen danger.

---

### **Skill Challenge Rules**

- Players must accumulate **5 total successes** before they reach **3 failures**.

- Each round, players describe how they help the ship navigate.

- Each round represents **10-20 minutes of sailing**.

- The DM determines **who rolls** based on their declared actions.

- Once a skill has been used successfully by a player, it **cannot be used again by the same player** (forces teamwork and creativity).

| **History**                           | 13 | Recalling old maps, stories, or legends about this passage.                 |
| **Investigation**                     | 14 | Analyzing patterns in the mist or how the reefs seem to be shifting.        |

- **Creative Ideas**: If a player has a unique idea that fits the situation, allow them to use it (e.g., **Intimidation** to bark orders at the crew).

- **Assisting Others**: Players can **Help** to grant advantage if they describe how they assist meaningfully.

### **Consequences of Failure**

If they **fail the challenge** (3 failures before 5 successes), choose one or more consequences:

1. **Ship Takes Damage**: The hull scrapes a reef, taking **2d10 bludgeoning damage**.

2. **Crew is Lost**: A crew member (or an NPC ally) is thrown overboard and must be rescued.

3. **Something Awakes**: The ship's disturbance **awakens a sea creature or spirit** linked to Sedna.

4. **Ship Becomes Stuck**: The ship lodges on a reef, requiring time and effort to free.

5. **Forced to Turn Back**: The party must spend hours **circling for another way through**.

---

### **Success Rewards**

If they **succeed** (5 successes first):

- They **arrive safely** at the city.

- They gain **advantage on an Insight check** regarding the **strange mist’s nature**.

- They might **glimpse shadows in the mist** hinting at future dangers.

---

### **Extra Twist: The Coin's Guidance**

- If the **navigator actively follows the Coin**, allow a one-time **reroll of a failed check**.

- However, the **Coin is leading them toward something…** they just don’t know what yet.
