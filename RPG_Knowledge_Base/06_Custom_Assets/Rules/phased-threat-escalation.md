# 🌒 PHASED THREAT ESCALATION – The Road to the Hollow Song

### **🌿 Phase 1: Wild Jungle (Outer Hexes)**

**Mood**: Tense, oppressive, but natural

**Threats**: Predators, curses, old ruins, weather

**Encounters**:

- Beast ambushes (serpent swarms, corpse lizards)

- Jungle diseases

- Forgotten shrines to Sedna and false gods

- Warnings carved in druidic or abyssal script

🌀 *Effect*: Threats feel *indifferent*, but deadly—nature is not yet aware of the intruders.

---

### **🌘 Phase 2: The Encroached Zone (Mid-Jungle)**

**Mood**: Wrongness seeps into the air—**rot without flies**, trees without birds, stone with veins.

**Trigger**: Once within **3 hexes of Vexir**

**Effects**:

- **Normal jungle encounters shift** to include **cult influence and residual magic**

- All Perception and Insight checks are made with **disadvantage** unless a light source is carried

- Pinch’s map tools start to **draw symbols on their own** during long rests

**Encounters**:

- Disfigured animals with extra eyes or fused limbs

- Unborn scouts hiding in trees (silent observers)

- Cult totems made from knotted hair and bone

- Whispering plants—investigating causes psychic damage

- A ruined **camp of explorers** who worshiped the Pretender after succumbing to madness

- Possessed beasts that act with **synchronized, intelligent aggression**

🌀 *Effect*: The party begins to feel watched. Rest becomes less effective. Divine casters may experience **ominous dreams or blocked guidance**.

---

### **🌑 Phase 3: The Hollow Grove (Temple Perimeter)**

**Mood**: *Sacrilege made manifest*. The jungle is not dead—it’s listening.

**Trigger**: Last 1–2 hexes surrounding Vexir

**Terrain Changes**:

- **Twisted trees** grow in impossible shapes (e.g., leaning toward the mountain)

- Air is thick with **droning**, like a song beneath the threshold of hearing

- Sound is muffled—**speech echoes wrong**; music distorts

- The **sun never fully penetrates the canopy**, even at noon

**Mechanics**:

- **Stealth is nearly impossible** due to muttering roots and noise-warping flora

- Spellcasting within this zone risks **wild effects** (DM may roll or apply narrative glitches)

- **Unnatural darkness** spreads from the Temple at dusk—no mundane light can pierce it

**Encounters**:

- **Cult of the Hollow Song**:

    - Malformed warlocks with silence-magic

    - Vermin Lord acolytes performing rituals with flesh-made instruments

    - Sacrificed Unborn bound to trees, still aware, whispering

- **Hollow Echo Beasts**: Creatures that **steal voices**

- **Shrines that hum** if touched—channel Atropus’ will

- **A “welcoming party”** of cultists that offer to guide them to the Temple... but not back

🌀 *Effect*: The jungle itself becomes a weapon. The party is in a place **forgotten by gods but remembered by something else**.

## 🕯 Optional Mechanics for Players

- **Rite of Silence**: Players may attempt a holy rite or magical silence to **mask their presence**—limited uses.

- **Sacrificial Shortcut**: A mad cultist may offer a “faster” path in exchange for... *something*.

- **Mutated Jungle Pathways**: Trails *open or close* depending on how the party behaves—e.g., if they burn something holy, the jungle lets them pass. If they speak the name of Sedna, the vines tighten.
