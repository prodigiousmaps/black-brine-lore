# How do apertures work!

- How do apertures work!

- Allows for the transfer of power (spell slots).

- Each wielder must use an attunement slot

- any caster can use an aperture. If you have spell slots or pact slots you may attune to an aperture.

- Each individual chooses how many slots they will contribute to the pool.

- Power: One spell slot equals one spell level.

    1. Focus may take levels to cast spells they already know to a maximum of 9th level

    2. Levels may be used to “upcast” as spell as stated in the spell description

- Configuration: The arrangement of casters imparts special benefits

    1. Discovering Configurations - Must be done through experimentation

        1. A configuration may be attempted with successful arcana check DC18

        2. Following a configuration attempt the exact properties of that configuration may be discerned with an identify spell.

    2. Vulnerabilities

        1. While connected casters must maintain concentration

        2. Casters may move at the rate afforded by the slowest caster

        3. Casters may not double move or dash

        4. Maintaining the configuration requires that contributors dedicate bonus actions and reactions

        5. The focus may use all actions but movement is restricted

        6. All casters must maintain a distance from each other of no more than 20 feet.

    3. Changing configuration takes a bonus action from each connected mage

    4. The effects of casting are dependent on the configuration of the linking.

    5. Configurations - Current configurations

        1. Circle configuration - flexible but less powerful. Any caster in the circle may utilize the pool of power. 

        2. Array configuration - all casters are individually connected to a single focus caster. Only the focus may cast spells utilizing the pool however all spells are cast with advantage.

        3. Linear configuration - casters are connected in a chain terminating with the focus. Only the focus may cast spells utilizing the pool. A single caster may only be the focus once per short rest. attacks are double damage, auto hit, max effect, etc.

        4. Bomb - Power may be added to a single focus by multiple casters to be released at once but the aperture is destroyed in the process.
