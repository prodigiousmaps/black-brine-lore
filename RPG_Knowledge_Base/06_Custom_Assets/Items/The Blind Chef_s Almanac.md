## Introduction

*The Blind Chef’s Almanac* is an unofficial, pirated copy of a much older deep gnome cooking manual. Passed down, recopied, and annotated by countless hands, this version is riddled with scribbled notes, substitutions, and dubious modifications. Some recipes are masterpieces of the Underdark’s culinary tradition. Others? Likely deadly mistakes waiting to happen.

The mere existence of this book is an act of heresy among the deep gnomes. Their kind does not write things down—especially not their culinary knowledge, which is traditionally passed through careful apprenticeship and oral tradition. Somewhere, at some point, a deep gnome broke this sacred rule, sharing their secrets with an unknown scribe of mysterious origin. Whether this was done willingly, under duress, or by deceit is a mystery lost to time. The author is unnamed, and none claim credit for this work.

The book itself has been banned in deep gnome settlements for centuries. Its copies have been hunted, burned, and erased from memory. The fact that one still exists—and that you hold it—makes you either very lucky or very doomed.

## A Note on Ingredients

Cooking in the eternal dark comes with challenges unknown to surface dwellers. Every meal is an act of survival, a delicate balance of hunting, foraging, and knowing what won’t melt your insides.

Common ingredients include:

- Glowcaps – Bioluminescent fungi with a mild sweetness, often used in broths and pastes.

- Trillimac Stalks – A fibrous, bread-like mushroom that serves as a staple food.

- Deep Rothe Milk – Strong, gamey dairy used in cheeses and sauces.

- Darksnail Shells – Ground into a fine, calcium-rich powder used for thickening soups.

- Fire Beetle Glands – When prepared correctly, add a spicy, ember-like heat to dishes.

Some dangerous but useful ingredients:

- Screaming Pepper – A duergar delicacy; too much and you might hallucinate or hear the voices of your ancestors.

- Midnight Lotus Root – A rare, inky-black plant that numbs the tongue and makes you temporarily resistant to poison (or so they say).

- Flickerfin Fish – Known for still twitching an hour after being cooked. Eat at your own risk.

## Cooking Superstitions & Rituals

- Always stir counterclockwise when making soups, or risk drawing bad luck.

- Salt from the surface must never touch deep rothe meat, lest it spoil within moments.

- Some say Screaming Pepper lets you “hear the truth” when eaten raw.
