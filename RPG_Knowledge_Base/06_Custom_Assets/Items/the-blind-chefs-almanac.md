### Introduction
*The Blind Chef’s Almanac* is an unofficial, pirated copy of an ancient manual.  
It breaks the deep gnome taboo of written culinary lore. Its origin is unknown.

### Ingredients
- **Glowcaps** – Bioluminescent fungi.  
- **Trillimac Stalks** – Bread-like mushroom.  
- **Deep Rothe Milk** – Gamey dairy.  
- **Darksnail Shells** – Used to thicken soups.  
- **Fire Beetle Glands** – Ember-like spice.  
- Dangerous: Screaming Pepper, Midnight Lotus Root, Flickerfin Fish.

### Example Recipes
- **Glowcap Bisque** – Creamy glowing soup.  
- **Whispering Fungus Broth** – Nourishing, mildly hallucinogenic.  
- **Deep Roasted Shadow Lizard** – Slow roasted delicacy.  
- **Umbral Meat Pie** – Dense pie of rothe & eel.  
- **Glowcap Honey Bread** – Subtly sweet, faintly glowing.  
- **Deep Ember Brew** – Burns throat, warms soul.

### Superstitions
- Always stir counterclockwise.  
- Surface salt spoils deep rothe meat.  
- Raw Screaming Pepper “reveals truth.”

### Annotations
Scrawled notes, missing pages, cryptic warnings.  
> “Cooked Flickerfin once. Still twitching. Funniest five minutes of my life.”
