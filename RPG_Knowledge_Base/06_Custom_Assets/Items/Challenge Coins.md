# Challenge Coins

## **Magical Safeguards on Black Brine’s Challenge Coins**

Since the **pirate captains of Black Brine** would never let something so valuable be stolen **without protection**, here’s how the coins are **secured**:

### **1. Every Coin is Marked with a Magical Signature**

- Each Challenge Coin is **inscribed with a unique sigil**, tied to the **captain’s blood or soul** at the time of forging.

- This makes it **difficult to duplicate**, as each coin’s **magic is distinct** and **can be sensed by those trained to do so**.

#### **How This Affects the Enemy**

- The Corsair-worshipers **cannot simply forge a new coin**—they must **use the stolen one carefully** or **find a way to erase its signature**.

- If a **pirate lord or mage examines the coin**, they **can tell it belonged to Grim Jack Carver**, raising suspicion.

- Certain **magical wards or doors in Black Brine** might be attuned to the coin’s **original captain**, meaning the enemy **may still face restricted access**.

---

### **2. Coins Can Be Tracked—But Only Under Specific Conditions**

- A **ritual performed by an experienced mage** can **locate a lost Challenge Coin**, but:

    - The process **takes time**—perhaps **a full day of preparation**.

    - The spell must **use a physical connection** to the lost coin (e.g., a personal item of the original owner).

    - It is **not precise**, showing only a **general direction or location**, but it **can confirm whether the coin is still in Black Brine or has left the city**.

#### **How This Affects the Enemy**

- The Corsair-worshipers **know they will eventually be hunted** once the coin is discovered missing.

- They might **move it frequently**, hiding it between **different spies or safe houses** to avoid being found.

- They **could attempt to suppress its signal** using **countermagic, dark rituals, or a specialized artifact**—but this could **leave its own trail** if the players investigate.

---

### **3. The Coin Reacts to Challenges** *(Built-in Security Against Impostors)*

- Challenge Coins **must be physically presented** to **prove identity**, and **a secret phrase or gesture** must be performed alongside it.

- If **someone uses the coin without knowing the phrase**, the coin **gives off a faint, unnatural glow**, marking them as a **fraud**.

- Some captains **engrave secondary glyphs onto their coins**, requiring the wielder to **press their thumb in a certain place or speak a specific word**.

#### **How This Affects the Enemy**

- The Corsair-worshipers **must avoid direct scrutiny**—they can **use the coin to fool casual encounters**, but they **can’t risk showing it to the wrong person**.

- If they are **forced to present it in front of a powerful Black Brine figure**, they **risk immediate exposure** if they don’t know **the correct words or motions**.

- They may **try to steal or forge information** on the **correct challenge response** before attempting high-risk deceptions.

### **Rupert’s Role in the Coin’s Recovery**

- Rupert, being **an expert in magic and lore**, will **immediately understand the risks** of a **stolen Challenge Coin** and push for **recovery efforts**.

- He may be able to **accelerate the tracking ritual**, but only if he **gains access to the right resources**—which he might **manipulate the crew into securing for him**.

- If the Corsair-worshipers **find a way to suppress or alter the coin’s signature**, Rupert may be the **only one capable of breaking their spell**—giving him further leverage over the crew.

---

### **How This Plays Out Over Several Sessions**

#### **Session 1-2: The Mystery Unfolds**

- **The Sea Scarab is found adrift, crew dead, coin missing** → Panic spreads in Black Brine.

- Players investigate the **ship’s logs, wounds on the bodies, and signs of Corsair infiltration**.

- **First rumors** of unfamiliar faces **asking questions about the ship** begin to surface.

#### **Session 3-4: The Enemy Makes Moves**

- **The Corsair-worshipers cautiously begin using the coin**, testing its limits.

- Players start to **notice signs of forged authority**—a spy may even attempt to **commandeer a ship or gain access to private meetings**.

- Rupert insists on **tracking the coin**—the ritual is prepared, but **the enemy catches wind of it and tries to disrupt the search**.

#### **Session 5+: The Confrontation & Coin’s Fate**

- Players **track the coin** to an **abandoned warehouse, hidden temple, or a Corsair-worshiper’s hideout**.

- The spy holding it may **be cornered and interrogated**, revealing **hints of a greater Corsair plan**.

- The players must **decide what to do next**—do they **eliminate the spy, leave them alive to misinform their leaders, or use the recovered coin to stage a counter-trap?**

---

### **Open Questions & Possible Twists**

1. **Should the players have competition for the coin’s recovery?**

    - A **rival pirate faction** could also be **hunting the spies**, complicating matters.

    - If someone **else recovers the coin first**, do they use it to **gain personal power** instead of returning it to Black Brine’s leadership?

2. **Does the enemy have a backup plan?**

    - If they realize the **coin will soon be found**, do they **discard it and steal another one**?

    - Do they **attempt to assassinate the crew before the players expose them**?

3. **Should the stolen coin unlock anything unique?**

    - Perhaps **Grim Jack Carver had a secret only accessible through his coin**—one that **neither the players nor the enemy anticipated**.
