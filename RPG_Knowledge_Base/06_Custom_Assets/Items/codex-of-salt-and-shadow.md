# Codex of Salt and Shadow

# 📖 **The Codex of Salt and Shadow**

### 🐚 Physical Description

A heavy tome bound in **water-logged eelhide**, slick to the touch. Its pages are **translucent** and shimmer like oil on water. When opened, **ink moves slowly** across the pages—never smudging, but subtly rearranging itself when not observed. Some pages appear **empty until submerged in saltwater**, at which point **hidden glyphs emerge** in fluid, spiraling scripts.

The codex smells of **brine, old blood, and rain-soaked stone**. It whispers faintly in silence and is warm when near seawater or leyline nodes.

## 🌀 Contents Overview

### ✴️ **I. Liturgies of the Abyssal Silence**

- Ritual prayers and forbidden psalms to Sedna.

- Invocations that **replace language with breath, silence, or drowning**.

- Describes how “words rot, but silence preserves.”

### 🐙 **II. The Unspoken History**

### **From the Codex of Salt and Shadow**

*etched in faded ink and pressed sea-lacquered leather, sealed with wax bearing a wave and an eye*

> *In the days when breath walked freely and the tides bowed to song, there came a voice not born of brine.*

*She rode upon winds unchained, with a laugh that bent the trees and eyes that stole worship from stone.*

*The people, once bent to the One Beneath, turned their faces skyward.*

*The drowning songs ceased. The deep altars lay dry. The temples opened to air, and incense climbed where blood once fell.*

*They called her the Shaper of the High Current,*

*The Sky-Blessed Flame,*

*The One Who Sings Without Chains.*

*But the Deep Mother does not forget. The Taker of Breath, She Who Waits Below—*

*She stirred in the silence left behind.*

*In a single tide without wave, the silence took shape. The sky was split. The earth wept salt.*

*Her vengeance fell not in rage, but in erasure.*

*The songs were swallowed. The statues wept. The faithful choked on empty air.*

*The False Flame was bound not in shackles, but in self.*

*Trapped within a vessel of gleaming gold, buried deep within her own temple—*

*A palace of wind, now silent stone, overtaken by root and ruin.*

*Seek the Temple of the Hollow Song,*

*at the base of Mount Vexir, where the jungle clings like memory and time forgets to pass.*

*There, the sky still sings her name—though none recall it.*

*Touch not the wind that calls you, traveler.*

*It remembers those who once worshipped.*

*It remembers who left.*

*And it remembers what must be claimed.*

### Notes for You (the DM):

- **The Shaper of the High Current** = Eshvahar (the Djinn)

---

### 🌊 **III. Sedna’s Gifts and Burdens**

- Instructions on the crafting of **Amphorae of Breath**, **Salted Eyes**, and **Brine Golems**.

- The **"Tide Key"** spell: Allows opening doors only visible when submerged or during high tide.

- Ritual of **Brine Veil**: Makes a caster invisible to scrying for 8 hours, but they must not speak or write for the duration.

- Side note on a creature called **“the First Swimmer”** who guards Naethyr’s drowned heart.

---

### 🌑 **IV. The Vein of Stillness**

- Describes leylines that run beneath the sea and jungle, converging at the **Vein of Stillness**, which runs beneath **Naethyr’s Crown**.

- Sedna **“still listens there”**.

- Her presence may **empower or consume** the unworthy.

- There’s mention of a **sealed chamber**—the “Stillbirth Chapel”—rumored to house a relic **older than Sedna**.

### 🧠 Additional Magical Properties

While attuned to the codex:

- Once per long rest, **Control Water** or **Water Breathing** can be cast without components.

- Ritual casting of **Augury** allows glimpses not of fate, but **Sedna’s will**—the answers are conveyed through water ripples or breath in the air.

- Once per week, the bearer can perform the **“Silence Offering”**:

    - Sit submerged and silent for 10 minutes. Sedna may grant a **cryptic vision** of something the player seeks—but the vision **never includes sound**.
