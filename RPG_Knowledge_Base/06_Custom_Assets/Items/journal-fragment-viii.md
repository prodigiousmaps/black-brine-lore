# Journal Fragment VIII

Faded ink and water damage obscure much of the entry. Still legible are scattered words and phrases:  
- “...the mist thicker now...”  
- “...trees whisper but none alive...”  
- “...coin or curse?...”  
- “...Strange Bones warned...”  

The rest is illegible, but the tone is frantic and fearful. Suggests the writer witnessed Sedna’s jungle changing unnaturally before vanishing.
