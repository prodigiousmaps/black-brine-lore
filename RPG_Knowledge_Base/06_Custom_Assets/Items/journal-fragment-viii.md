# Excerpt
- The canopy seems to lean closer, as if listening.
- A coin like Waterdeep’s, but with an open mouth instead of a crown.
- Marked three trees; by dusk, there were four.
- Dovain listens for something he calls “shape, not sound.”
- Dreams beneath roots with a song that made teeth ache.
- Expedition may have been doomed from the start.
- “The jungle has no gold. Only hunger.” — J.
