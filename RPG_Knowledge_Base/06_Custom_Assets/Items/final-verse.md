# The Final Verse

> “When the tide breaks black and the stars turn hollow,  
> the drowned shall rise in chorus,  
> and the song unmade shall bind the chains anew.”

Believed to be the closing passage of a longer prophecy, its meaning is hotly debated.  
- Some claim it foretells Sedna’s release.  
- Others believe it marks the Hollow Goddess’s triumph.  
- Still others say it speaks to balance: neither freed, nor destroyed, but bound in endless cycle.
