# Challenge Coins of Black Brine

### Magical Safeguards
1. **Magical Signature** – Bound to captain’s blood or soul; cannot be forged.  
2. **Tracking** – Ritual possible with connection item; imprecise but reveals region.  
3. **Challenge Response** – Requires phrase or gesture; misuse exposes impostors.

### Enemy Implications
- Corsair-worshipers cannot easily forge.  
- Coins risky to use openly.  
- Suppression rituals possible but traceable.

### Rupert’s Role
Rupert can accelerate rituals, break suppression, and leverage the crew.

### Campaign Arc
- **Sessions 1–2**: Missing coin discovered.  
- **3–4**: Enemy begins testing; tracking ritual contested.  
- **5+**: Confrontation, decision on coin’s fate.

### Twists
- Rival factions may hunt coin.  
- Enemy might discard coin for another.  
- Coin may unlock hidden secret of captain Grim Jack Carver.
