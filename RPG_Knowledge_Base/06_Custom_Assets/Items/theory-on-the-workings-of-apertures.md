# Theory on the Workings of Apertures

### Core Principles
- Apertures allow **transfer of spell slots**.  
- Any caster with spell/pact slots may attune.  
- Attunement consumes a slot.  
- Each caster chooses how many slots to contribute.  
- 1 slot = 1 level of spell energy.

### Casting with Apertures
- Focus caster may use levels to cast known spells (up to 9th).  
- Levels can upcast spells.  

### Configurations
1. **Circle** – Flexible, any caster may use pool.  
2. **Array** – All link to a focus; focus casts with advantage.  
3. **Linear** – Chain ends at focus; devastating attacks; focus limited once/short rest.  
4. **Bomb** – Pool channeled into single destructive release, destroying aperture.

### Vulnerabilities
- All casters must maintain concentration.  
- Movement limited to slowest caster; no dash.  
- Bonus actions & reactions consumed to maintain link.  
- Must remain within 20 ft.  
- Reconfiguration requires bonus actions from all.  
- Focus may act but moves slowly.  

### Discovery
- Configurations must be experimented.  
- Arcana DC 18 to attempt.  
- Identify reveals properties after attempt.
