# Tavern Rivalry

### **The Powder Keg vs. The Golden Gull**

While **both taverns serve Black Brine’s rough and ruthless clientele**, they cater to **very different crowds**—and the rivalry between them is **as explosive as a Powder Keg barrel lit with a Golden Gull cigar**.

The feud isn’t just about **class—it’s about power**. Each tavern serves as **a hub for different factions**, and tensions have been **boiling for years**.

---

### **The Core Rivalry: Money vs. Might**

- The **Golden Gull** represents **wealth, influence, and cunning politics**—it’s where **deals are made, alliances are forged, and assassins are hired**.

- The **Powder Keg** represents **raw strength, survival, and chaos**—it’s where **mercenaries, gunslingers, and pirates prove their worth through fists and firepower**.

- **The city’s power is split between these two worlds**, and both **taverns act as battlegrounds** for control over Black Brine’s underworld.

---

### **Key Figures in the Rivalry**

#### **Aldo Vance (Golden Gull Owner) vs. Harlow "Blastcap" Grint (Powder Keg Owner)**

- **Aldo sees Blastcap as an uneducated brute**, a relic of a time before **Black Brine’s economy revolved around high-stakes deals and politics**.

- **Blastcap sees Aldo as a backstabbing snake**, poisoning Black Brine with **"fancy words and poisoned drinks" instead of honest fights**.

- **They used to be allies**, smuggling together years ago—but **a deal went south**, and now they **haven’t spoken in over a decade**.

- **Each secretly tries to sabotage the other**, planting rumors, sending spies, and occasionally **paying for "accidents" to happen**.

---

### **Tension Points & Ongoing Conflicts**

1. **The Annual King's Coin Night**

    - Once a year, the **Council of Captains gathers to drink together**, and the location **switches between the two taverns**.

    - **Whoever wins the bid to host the night earns immense prestige**, and both taverns **will do anything to secure the event**.

2. **The Lost Shipment Incident**

    - **A cache of stolen dwarven gunpowder** was meant for the Powder Keg—but **someone bribed the couriers to sell it to the Golden Gull instead**.

    - Now, **Blastcap is furious and looking for revenge**, and **Aldo is laughing over his expensive cigars**.

3. **Murder in the Golden Gull**

    - **A prominent pirate captain was poisoned during a high-stakes game** in the Golden Gull.

    - **The blame has been placed on a mercenary last seen drinking at the Powder Keg**, escalating tensions between the two factions.

---

### **Potential Story Hooks**

- **The Party Caught in the Middle** – Aldo and Blastcap both **offer the party a job**—but taking one means **making an enemy of the other**.

- **A Secret Third Player** – Someone **outside both taverns is fueling the rivalry**, and it’s up to the party to **find out why**.

- **A Tavern War Erupts** – An **all-out brawl** breaks out between **Golden Gull patrons and Powder Keg regulars**, and the party must **choose a side—or stop the madness**.

---

Now, **Black Brine has an active tavern feud**, a split **between wealth and raw power**, and **two major factions vying for dominance**. Would you like to add a **smaller neutral establishment**, or is this rivalry **enough conflict for now**?
