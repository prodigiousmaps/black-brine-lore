# Legends
- Said to walk the line between Sedna’s chains and the Hollow Goddess’ storms.  
- Captains claim whole fleets have been carried into fog or fire by Djinn’s wrath.  
- Folktales say they grant three wishes but twist them cruelly.

# Cultural Beliefs
- Sailors carve warding sigils on masts to keep them at bay.  
- The Twilight Society whispers they commune with Djinn in ritual haze.  
- Some believe Djinn are fragments of the Godless Wind itself.

# Adventure Hooks
- A forgotten lamp dredged up from a wreck calls to a crewmember.  
- A storm over Black Brine carries voices offering bargains.  
- A noble hires the party to bind a Djinn—just as its rivals plot to free it.
