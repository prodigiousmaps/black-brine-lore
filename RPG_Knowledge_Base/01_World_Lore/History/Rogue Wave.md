# Rogue Wave

**The Legend of the Ship**

- Known throughout **Black Brine’s pirate history**, it is whispered that every **few centuries**, the ship **emerges from the mist**, seeking a new crew.

- Those who sail it are **destined for legendary deeds**, their names woven into the **dark and glorious history of the seas**.

- After their time is done, the ship **disappears once more**, vanishing into **fog, the depths, or perhaps another plane altogether**.

- No one knows where it **goes between its appearances**, though some say it **returns to Sedna’s embrace** or **wanders the Elemental Plane of Air**, waiting for the right moment to return.

- **Those who have tried to take it by force have failed**—the ship **will not be claimed**, only **accepted**.

### **Reactions to the Ship's Return**

- **Reverence & Fear**:

    - The **most superstitious pirates** might see its return as **an omen of great change**—either fortune or disaster.

    - Some captains may **refuse to sail near it**, believing it **brings the favor of Sedna or the wrath of something older**.

- **Jealousy & Rivalry**:

    - Other captains **resent the crew**, believing the ship’s power was **meant for them** instead.

    - The **Deadliest Pirate Lords** may seek to **test** the new crew, seeing if they are **worthy of the legend**—or if they can be **replaced**.

### **What the Players Know**

- They **do not yet know the ship’s true name** or **why it chose them**.

- They named it **The Rogue Wave**, giving it a **new identity for a new age**.

- **Some people recognize it** and react with **awe, fear, or ambition**, but the players don’t yet understand why.

### **The Unraveling Mystery**

- **Fragments of Old Crew Logs**: They may find **scraps of journals, carvings in the ship’s wood, or markings on the shrine** from past crews, hinting at previous voyages.

- **The Name Hidden in the Wind**: If they listen carefully, they might **hear a whisper of its true name carried on the breeze**, but it is incomplete.

- **The Ship Remembers**: As they bond with it, they may **experience echoes of past journeys**, as if the ship itself **wants to show them what came before**.
