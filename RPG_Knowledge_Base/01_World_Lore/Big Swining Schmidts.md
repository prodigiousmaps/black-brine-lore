# Big Swining Schmidts

A song written by the Bard Raferty Amcathra
​
​

**

Big Swinging Schmidts

there once was a farmer

his name was called Schmidt 

to levys and nobles

he would not submit 

his children were shoeless 

his cupboards were bare 

his wife stuffed the pillows 

with locks of her hair 

nobles would tax him 

just for the sport 

but Schmidt didn’t care 

he was hung like a horse!

he had a big swinging dick 

we have big swinging dicks 

if not for our members 

we’d be in a fix 

we have big swinging dicks 

we have big swinging dicks 

when our day finally comes 

we will bugger the rich!

[FIDDLE SOLO]

Good Sallie Schmidt

down Cumberton Way

in matters of freedom

could lecture all day

her fingers were calloused

her shoulders were strong

her head full of rebel

her heart full of song

the lords made demands

their levy’s expensive 

but she didn’t care

cause her chest was extensive!

she had big swinging tits

we have big swinging tits 

if not for our Jubblies 

we’d be in a fix

we have big swinging tits 

we have big swinging tits

when the taxman arrives 

we’ll smother the bitch!
