# Rupert's Welcome Speech

I am Rupert Richthorn, yes THEE Rupert Richthorn, and you all are unemployed but I hope to change your fortunes. Some of you come highly recommended and others of you...do not. In fact, some of you appear to have left no familial or social footprint anywhere. However, your breeding, or inbreeding, is no concern of mine.  What is of concern are your capabilities and your appreciation of wealth and opportunity

As you may know (if you have half a brain and a nose for rot), the land is awash in foul magics and mages my friends are the worst bunch of megalomaniacal bastards faerun has to offer. In fact I would venture to say that Wizards rank among the most self-interested, miserable, cheating, sanctimonious and gratuitously self-aggrandizing shit stains you’ll ever meet. I would know, I am one after all.

If there is one thing we mages love to do, it’s show eachother up. Wherever you find assembled more than one mage you will also quickly discover a fetid swamp of bumfuckery so impenetrable that not even the most depraved would dare enter. I am looking for a few souls brave enough to stand up to these foul magics in exchange for untold wealth as members of the exalted League of Prodigious Illumination. Right now, each of you is but a lowly contractor but no doubt your mind is buzzing with excitement at the possibility of full membership.

The benefits of association with the LPI are many fold, so many folds they are beyond counting! Allow me to impart to you, but a meager sample of our competitive offerings.

1. Each member receives a stipend of 10 gold per week from LPI coffers. Let me tell you this well above the rate of any enlisted man or woman on the continent with the possible exception Thay. Nobody knows what those bloody red wizards get up to but I assure you that should you join their ranks you will be micromanaged into a smoking hole.

2. A gold foil certificate of membership Signed by ME, Rupert Richthorn

3. Standard 10% discount in the LPI merch store

4. Entry into the LPI network of operatives who span the continent. You shall never find yourself without allies again!

5. A % of spoils from all associated LPI assignments! This is not a profit making organization but profit we do.

6. Health and wellness benefits without equal in the clandestine operators industry

7. AND a generous retirement matching program should you live long enough

Now, let me get to the particulars of the mission at hand!

1. Two days ago an LPI operator set out from Hlondeth bound for Ormath.  He was carrying an important package for Lord Quwen, the former ruler of that fair city.  

2. His Caravan was attacked in Deepwing pass

3. I have scryed the area only to see a foul beast drag the unfortunate man into the hills kicking and screaming.

4. I need to you to track him down and recover the package and bring it to me.  I will deliver the bloody thing myself.
