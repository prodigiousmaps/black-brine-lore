# Goddess Sedna

[[image]]

A crazed goddess of witchcraft and the dark depths. She appears as a sea hag, with fingers that end in ragged stumps. Sedna shares a domain with Prince Sashelas, and is occasionally allied with him. Sedna was once a beautiful goddess of druids who walked along the land. Her father, the wild god Malar, desired a pact with the Dark Lords of the Depths, and promised Sedna’s hand to the the Void of the Sea. When Sedna clung to his canoe to save herself from the depths, Malar bit off her fingers. In the dark depths, Sedna became the unwilling Bride of the Void, and learned many dark rituals that cannot be spoken in the light of day. Using these dark rituals, Sedna betrayed her husband, and sealed his monstrous body within his palace, behind a barrier of blood magic. She usurped her husband’s position as God of the depths, and demanded the devotion of the Tritons. To this day, Sedna maintains the blood-barrier through dread sacrifice. Though she is ‘benevolent’ towards the races of land, she is intensely jealous of them. Her devotees are often hexblade warlocks, who use their weapons to make blood sacrifices. Sedna is also a Goddess of death who accepts the corruption and filth of corpses, and purges the souls of the damned so that they are fit to stand before The Raven Queen.
