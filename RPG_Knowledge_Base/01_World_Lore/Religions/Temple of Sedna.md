# Temple of Sedna

## Overview
Carved into the salt-bitten cliffs at the edge of Little Sedna, the Temple of Sedna is both sacred site and tidal tomb. Accessible only at low tide, its cavernous interior shifts between hushed sanctuary and flooded reliquary. Worshipers gather here in silence to honor the goddess of the deep, whose presence is said to rise and fall with the sea.

## Geography
The temple begins as a narrow fissure in the cliffside, opening into a vast oceanic cavern with natural columns and carved walkways. At high tide, the sea invades the temple, swallowing altars, pews, and pilgrims alike. At low tide, barnacle-covered stone floors are exposed, slick and shining in the dark.

## Notable Features
- **The Deep Altar**: A circular dais submerged half the day. Ritual offerings are left here in weighted bowls and driftwood cages.
- **The Breathless Font**: A pool said to grant visions if one can hold their breath beneath its surface long enough.
- **The Drowned Reliquary**: A sealed lower chamber visible only when the tide recedes completely. Said to contain artifacts lost to the deep—and perhaps not entirely dormant.

## Demographics
Used by devoted followers, local priests, and those desperate enough to seek Sedna’s favor. Outsiders are tolerated but not trusted. Most who come alone, leave changed.

## Government & Politics
Ruled by **Priestess Nema**, the Temple holds great sway over Little Sedna’s people and rituals. Though independent of the Captain’s Council, the temple’s power is secured through mystery, prophecy, and fear.

## Economy
Operates on offerings—both material and spiritual. Rare items from shipwrecks are sometimes fished up and repurposed as relics or sold discreetly to fund the temple’s upkeep.

## Culture & Daily Life
Silent worship, bone chants, and tide-watching define the rhythm of life here. Initiates live communally in chambers carved high above the flooding line. Pilgrims seek Sedna’s blessing for revenge, forgiveness, or truth.

## Notable NPCs
- **Priestess Nema**: Sedna’s cold-eyed herald, who reads dreams and guides rituals. Said to have drowned once, but came back different.
- **Ulo the Hollow**: An acolyte who fasts until visions come. Speaks only in riddles when the tide turns.

## Adventure Hooks
- A relic has gone missing—vanished from a locked reliquary during high tide.
- A ritual goes wrong, and one of the party is claimed by the sea—but speaks Sedna’s voice upon returning.
- A cult within the temple has begun preaching of a “Second Drowning.”

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- Beneath the temple lies a buried entrance to Sedna’s prison—sealed long ago by rival gods.
- Some priests believe the temple itself is alive, a divine leviathan turned to stone.
- The tide doesn’t merely flood—it listens.
