# Sedna Lore Poem

**

In the days when breath walked freely and the tides bowed to song, there came a voice not born of brine.

She rode upon winds unchained, with a laugh that bent the trees and eyes that stole worship from stone.

The people, once bent to the One Beneath, turned their faces skyward.

The drowning songs ceased. The deep altars lay dry. The temples opened to air, and incense climbed where blood once fell.

They called her the Shaper of the High Current,

The Sky-Blessed Flame,

The One Who Sings Without Chains.

But the Deep Mother does not forget. The Taker of Breath, She Who Waits Below—

She stirred in the silence left behind.

In a single tide without wave, the silence took shape. The sky was split. The earth wept salt.

Her vengeance fell not in rage, but in erasure.

The songs were swallowed. The statues wept. The faithful choked on empty air.

The False Flame was bound not in shackles, but in self.

Trapped within a vessel of gleaming gold, buried deep within her own temple—

A palace of wind, now silent stone, overtaken by root and ruin.

The Temple of the Hollow Song,

In the shadow of Vexir, where the jungle clings like memory and time forgets to pass.

There, the sky still sings her name—though none recall it.

Touch not the wind that calls you.

It remembers those who once worshipped.

It remembers who left.

And it remembers what must be claimed.
