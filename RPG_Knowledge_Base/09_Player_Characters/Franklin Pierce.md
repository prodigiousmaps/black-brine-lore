backstory:
  Franklin never knew his parents, growing up on the streets of Zazesspur, surviving by charm and deception. He learned early that fake promises pay better than honest work. His life of scams eventually forced him out of town after betraying a merchant partner. Since then, he’s impersonated adventurers, faked quests, and spun elaborate lies to part fools from their gold. His rapier was stolen from that same merchant—his only true trophy.
