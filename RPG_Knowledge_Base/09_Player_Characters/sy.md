# Description
Lithe swimmer’s build; sea-toned skin with green-blue sheen; long dark hair; reflective green eyes; ritual scarring along ribs; slightly webbed fingers; trident-shaped sentient dagger at the belt.

# Personality
- Quiet, intense, secretive—but fiercely loyal once earned.  
- Ideal: “Power comes from the depths—earned, not inherited.”  
- Bond: The dagger—last tie to his father.  
- Flaw: Guilt over Nymh and his father’s fate.

# Backstory
Raised among smugglers in Ithmong; warned about his mother’s ambitions; found the bound blade and fled before becoming her pawn.

# Recent History
- Escaped a merchant brig with Pinch and Franklin.  
- Struck dark bargains in a cursed ruin; took the helm of a mastless, planar ship.  
- Sails toward Black Brine under Captain Tasty Bite’s wary eye.

# Skills & Expertise
Stealth, sabotage, underwater navigation; pact-bound hexblade; intimate with coastal smuggler routes.

# Inventory
Trident-like hexblade dagger, a smoke-scarred arcane journal, salt-sealed satchel, scattered tokens from old networks.

# Reputation
A quiet rumor along the coast; a few deep cults recognize the blade he bears.

# Notes
The dagger hides more secrets; something in the deep still calls to him.
