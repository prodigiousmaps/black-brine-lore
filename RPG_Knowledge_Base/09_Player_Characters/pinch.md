# Description
Small, wiry frame; dusty-gray skin; wild white shock of hair; ink-black eyes. Patchwork leathers over scholar’s robes, magnifying spectacles, satchel stained with ink and maps.

# Personality
- Obsessively curious about written language; values cleverness over strength.  
- Ideal: “The world is a puzzle—every riddle has a key.”  
- Bond: His journal of maps and lore is life itself.  
- Flaw: Risks everything for knowledge or rare texts.

# Backstory
Shunned by his folk for loving script over stone, he found a place topside among thieves and scholars who prized his hand and his mind.

# Recent History
- Escaped shipboard imprisonment with Sy and Franklin.  
- Survived a ruin of Shar; bargained with a minotaur named Ruben.  
- Helped seize a mastless, planar ship; now bound for Black Brine.

# Skills & Expertise
Illusions, stealth, locks; fluent scribe and calligrapher; cartographer of hidden places and forbidden lore.

# Inventory
Calligraphy kit, Book of Illusions, concealed lockpicks, scroll case of maps, driftwood mask from a jungle shrine (echoes of the past).

# Reputation
Unknown to most, whispered of in scribe circles; sells maps to nobles and thieves alike.

# Notes
His illusions mirror memories that aren’t his; a subtle jungle curse lingers.
