# Appearance
Lean and wiry, dark hair slicked back with careless charm, hazel eyes that are always sizing up the room. Threadbare finery, a gilded stolen rapier, and a subtle forearm tattoo from a defunct thieves’ guild.

# Personality
- Quick-witted, smooth-talking; loyalty earned, not assumed.  
- Ideal: “Truth is flexible. Coin is real.”  
- Bond: Grudging loyalty to his new crew.  
- Flaw: Can’t resist a good con—even when it’s a bad idea.

# Backstory
An orphan of Zazesspur’s streets, Franklin learned early that forged promises paid better than honest labor. After burning a merchant partner and stealing his rapier, he fled town and drifted from scam to scam.

# Recent History
- Escaped a brig with Sy and Pinch.  
- Survived a cursed ruin and seized a magical, mastless ship.  
- Heading to Black Brine under Captain Tasty Bite’s invitation.

# Skills & Expertise
Master forger and mimic, gambler, showman; a capable duelist when cornered.

# Inventory
Weighted dice, marked cards, forged papers, elegant rapier, assorted magical trinkets “acquired” on the way.

# Reputation
“The Silver Scribe” in some circles; wanted in at least two ports. Might talk his way into—or out of—any fortress.

# Notes
May seek redemption… or just a bigger score. Knows something about a sealed chest from near Mezro and isn’t telling.
