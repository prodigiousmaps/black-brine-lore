overview: >
  The Twilight Society is an exclusive circle of wealthy, beautiful, and dangerous elites who worship pleasure, secrecy, and subtle power. Cloaked in hedonism and mysticism, they operate under the guise of socialites and art patrons, but beneath the velvet and wine lies a hidden devotion to the goddess Sharess. The society manipulates, corrupts, and blackmails its way through Black Brine’s high places, cloaking vice in the perfume of nobility.

    A rooftop pleasure garden above the Lending House, filled with exotic flora, silken cushions, and concealed passageways. Protected by enchantments of illusion and silence.

rivalries:
  - Opposed by Rosy and the Church of Sedna for undermining discipline and tradition
  - Viewed with disdain by the Temple of the Chained God, which considers them a moral plague
  - In quiet competition with the Red Door Alchemy Shop for arcane and sensual potions

influence: >
  The Twilight Society has its hooks in lenders, officers, aristocrats, and entertainers. Many owe them favors—few dare to admit it. Their decadence masks an efficient intelligence network.

hooks:
  - A member's secret has been stolen and threatens to unravel the society
  - The Velvet Nest is hosting an invite-only masquerade—and someone isn’t on the list
  - A Twilight acolyte is selling sacred pleasure elixirs that seem to drive users mad
