# Overview 
  The Twilight Society is an exclusive circle of wealthy, beautiful, and dangerous elites who worship pleasure, secrecy, and subtle power. Cloaked in hedonism and mysticism, they operate under the guise of socialites and art patrons, but beneath the velvet and wine lies a hidden devotion to the goddess Sharess. The society manipulates, corrupts, and blackmails its way through Black Brine’s high places, cloaking vice in the perfume of nobility.

# Leader
  name: Vel Corven
  race: Androgynous Elf (unknown lineage)
  role: High Host of the Society

# Description
    A radiant figure of ambiguous gender, velvety voice, and effortless charm. Vel is rumored to be centuries old and never seen in daylight. Their mask changes nightly.

# Members
  demographics: Nobles, entertainers, fallen clerics, ex-pirates, ambitious merchants
  initiation: Invitation-only. New members must offer a personal secret of value, to be held in trust—or used for leverage.

# Beliefs
  - Pleasure is the highest form of power
  - Secrets are the purest form of currency
  - Pain and joy are divine instruments of transformation
  - Public morality is a lie for the weak

# Customs
  - Midnight gatherings marked by masked revels and silent auctions of forbidden artifacts
  - Rituals held in perfumed candlelight involving wine, veils, and whispered prayers to Sharess
  - The “Velvet Mark” – a perfume blend unique to each member, meant to intoxicate and signal allegiance

# Notable_location
  name: The Velvet Nest
  description: >
    A rooftop pleasure garden above the Lending House, filled with exotic flora, silken cushions, and concealed passageways. Protected by enchantments of illusion and silence.

# Rivalries
  - Opposed by Rosy and the Church of Sedna for undermining discipline and tradition
  - Viewed with disdain by the Temple of the Chained God, which considers them a moral plague
  - In quiet competition with the Red Door Alchemy Shop for arcane and sensual potions

# Influence
  The Twilight Society has its hooks in lenders, officers, aristocrats, and entertainers. Many owe them favors—few dare to admit it. Their decadence masks an efficient intelligence network.

# Hooks
  - A member's secret has been stolen and threatens to unravel the society
  - The Velvet Nest is hosting an invite-only masquerade—and someone isn’t on the list
  - A Twilight acolyte is selling sacred pleasure elixirs that seem to drive users mad
