# Cult - Forgotten Wind

**The Caste System of the Cult of the Forgotten Wind**

**After centuries of isolation, jungle survival, and devotion to a false god, the cult has degenerated into a monstrous hierarchy of fanatics. Each caste serves a distinct role, ensuring their survival as they await the return of their imprisoned goddess.**

---

## **1. The Howling Ones** *(Lowest Caste – Savage Hunters)*

> *"You will hear them before you see them—if you're lucky. If you're not, you will only hear the breath in your ear before the teeth sink in."*

— Old Black Brine superstition

- These **twisted remnants** of the original civilization have **lost most of their humanity** after centuries in the jungle.

- Their **bones are warped**, their **eyes reflective like a predator’s**, and their **limbs unnaturally long** for climbing and leaping.

- They **travel through the canopy**, using **hooked claws and elongated limbs** to swing between trees **like silent shadows**.

- They **never speak**, only emitting **choking, guttural howls** that echo through the jungle before an attack.

- Their **skin is covered in sigils carved by the higher castes**, believed to **channel the Djinn’s dormant power**, but in reality, they only **bind them to servitude**.

#### **Abilities & Tactics**

- **Tree Walkers** – They move **almost unseen** through the canopy, dropping onto victims like **silent ghosts**.

- **Blood Frenzy** – The scent of **wounded flesh** sends them into **a berserker rage**—they will not stop attacking until either **they or their prey is dead**.

- **Wind-Touched Reflexes** – They seem to **sense movement before it happens**, making them **terrifying ambush predators**.

#### **Horrific Signs of Their Presence**

- **High in the trees**, corpses are **hanging upside-down, drained of blood**, left as **offerings to the Djinn**.

- **Scratched symbols in bark and exposed roots**, warnings left behind by **those who barely escaped**.

- **Echoing howls through the jungle**, seemingly coming from **everywhere at once**.

---

## **2. The Stormborn** *(Middle Caste – Zealous Warriors)*

> *"The first wave comes like the wind, fast and mindless. The second comes like a storm—organized, merciless, and certain of victory."*

— Anonymous Black Brine survivor

- The **Stormborn** are the **fanatical war priests and warriors** of the Cult—still savage, but **retaining intelligence and strategy**.

- They lead **hunting parties**, coordinate **ritual sacrifices**, and **communicate with the higher castes**.

- Their bodies are **covered in ritual scars and markings**, each symbol believed to **strengthen their bond to the Djinn**.

- **Unlike the Howling Ones, they speak**, using **a guttural, broken version of their ancient language**, mixing it with **hissing and breathy syllables**.

- They **believe in the prophecy completely**—that the return of the ship means their goddess **will awaken soon**.

#### **Abilities & Tactics**

- **Command the Howling Ones** – They control the **feral hunters**, directing them **like a wolf pack**.

- **Elemental Fury** – They **channel primal air magic**, creating **localized bursts of wind to blind enemies or knock them down**.

- **Storm-Touched Skin** – Their flesh is **hardened like aged bark**, resistant to **weak strikes and minor spells**.

#### **Signs of Their Presence**

- **Effigies of bone and cloth**, tied with **twisting spirals of braided hair**, placed at jungle crossings as **warnings to outsiders**.

- **Deep, rhythmic chanting** heard **from unseen sources**, as if the jungle itself is whispering to you.

- **Fresh sacrifices**, their chests cut open to **let the wind carry their souls to the Djinn**.

---

## **3. The Windcallers** *(Highest Caste – Eldritch Priesthood)*

> *"You cannot run from the wind. You cannot hide from it. You can only submit."*

— First words spoken by a captured Windcaller

- The **Windcallers are the masterminds** behind the cult, the **last remnants of self-aware intelligence among their people**.

- They are **physically frail** but **immensely powerful in sorcery**, using **ancient air magic and blood rituals** to maintain their dominion.

- Their bodies are **grotesquely elongated**, their **flesh twisted by centuries of ritual offerings**—some have **arms that end in thin, elongated fingers**, others have **blind, gaping eyes that see without sight**.

- They **remember the old prophecies fully** and are **the only ones who truly understand the ship’s importance**.

- They **believe the new crew may be the Chosen Ones**, sent to **awaken their lost goddess**.

- If the players **refuse to cooperate**, the Windcallers will **turn the entire jungle against them**.

#### **Abilities & Tactics**

- **Control the Stormborn & Howling Ones** – Through **chants and blood magic**, they **direct the lower castes with absolute authority**.

- **Whispers on the Wind** – They can **speak across vast distances**, their words carried by the breeze into **the ears of their enemies**.

- **Summoners of the Sky Queen’s Wrath** – They can **summon great winds, sudden lightning strikes, and suffocating storms**, making the jungle itself **a living nightmare**.

#### **Signs of Their Presence**

- **The jungle is unnaturally silent**—no birds, no insects, only the wind through the trees.

- **Symbols carved into stone**, pulsating faintly with **magic that repels water**, a defiance of Sedna’s power.

- **An unnatural fog rolls in**, revealing **shadowed figures moving without sound**, glimpsed only in the periphery of vision.

---

### **The Cult’s Grand Plan**

- The Windcallers **want the Djinn freed**, believing that she **will reward them with divine favor**.

- They **do not realize** that the Djinn **does not care about them**—she **hates all mortals**, including her own followers.

- If they succeed, she will **remake them into something else**—twisting their forms into **pure wind and fury**, **sacrificing them as the first offering of her rebirth**.

- The players must **decide what to do with this knowledge**:

    - **Use the Cult as a tool**, letting them fight Black Brine before betraying them.

    - **Crush them outright**, preventing them from **releasing their false goddess**.

    - **Manipulate the Windcallers**, leading them **into a final, devastating confrontation with Rupert, Black Brine, or Sedna’s faithful priests**.

---

### **Rupert’s Perspective on the Cult**

- Rupert sees the cult as **a necessary evil to investigate**—he knows they are **insane, but they have knowledge of the ship’s past**.

- He **wants to capture a Windcaller alive**, believing he can **extract the Djinn’s secrets from them**.

- If he **learns too much**, he may **try to release the Djinn himself**, thinking he can **bargain with her**—a fatal mistake.
