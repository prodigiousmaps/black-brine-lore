# Structure
- Overseen nominally by the Captain’s Council, though each inquisitor serves a fleet first.
- Files, ledgers, and testimonies are stored in the Ledger Vault.
- Interrogations held in rune-locked chambers, some public in the Stone Court.

# Culture
Feared and politically volatile. Inquisitors undermine each other as often as they pursue justice.

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Several inquisitors are secretly loyal to Sedna’s cult.
- The Ledger Vault holds blackmail on every captain.
- Relics beneath the Stone Court bind truth to blood.
