# Mistwalk

## Overview
Mistwalk is the nerve center of Black Brine—equal parts gilded theater and dagger’s edge. It’s where the rich strut, the spies whisper, and the cult of Sedna watches from every shadow. The cobbled plazas gleam with wealth and blood alike, and no deal is clean, no ally is loyal for long. Mist swirls like perfume through its streets, thick with incense and secrets.

## Geography
A tiered district built along the heart of the city, overlooking the Black Brine River and crisscrossed with ornate bridges and causeways. Its upper levels are opulent and maze-like, while the alleys below teem with street markets, shrines, and informants. The ever-present fog rolls in heavier here, clinging to stone and soul alike.

## Notable Features
- **City Hull**: A grounded ancient galleon that serves as the seat of Black Brine’s government and court—a fortress of splinters, barnacles, and bureaucracy.
- **Gallows Market**: A plaza of brilliant multicolored cobblestones and high fashion, shadowed by the oppressive Temple of the Chained God.
- **The Captain’s Club**: A private, smoke-filled den of gambling, music, and backroom deals, restricted to Black Brine’s most dangerous elite.
- **Cutty’s Blades**: Luxury weapons boutique and dueling hall; upstairs lies the secret HQ of the Widowmakers pirate fleet.
- **Temple of the Chained God**: A towering foreign cathedral that feeds and houses retired pirates—under the guise of charity but with the whisper of indoctrination. A source of quiet tension among Mistwalk's ruling elite.

## Demographics
A mix of wealthy captains, cultists, diplomats, spies, retired pirates, and merchants. Mistwalk is also home to the city’s bureaucrats and priesthood. Behind the finery, paranoia and cruelty bloom in equal measure.

## Government & Politics
The Captain’s Council meets in City Hull and exerts its rule from here—but not without friction. The Temple of the Chained God exerts increasing influence through charity and care of the wounded and retired, though many suspect mind-bending sermons and subtle conversions. Rosy’s cult keeps a close eye on both.

## Economy
Mistwalk thrives on trade, extortion, information, and control. Legal and illegal trade flow through its well-defended gates. Guilds and factions negotiate here—some with coin, others with blades.

## Culture & Daily Life
Opulence above, rot below. Perfumed streets, dueling schools, and shrines stand beside alleys stinking of incense and blood. Wealthy citizens mask their fears with fashion and feasts, while the poor watch from the shadows, waiting for the next fall.

## Notable NPCs
- **Gun Deck Rosy**: Sedna’s high priestess and governor of Black Brine.
- **Father Karr**: Serene-faced high priest of the Chained God, who smiles too often and speaks too softly.
- **Cutty**: Blade merchant and former duelist, sharp-eyed and sharper-tongued.

## Adventure Hooks
- A captain’s duel ends in a mysterious vanishing—no blood, no body, only fog.
- A retired pirate in the care of the Chained God temple starts speaking in tongues and vanishes into the mist.
- A key map is said to be hidden in Cutty’s private vault—accessed only by winning a duel on his floor.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- The Widowmakers fleet plots assassinations from the rafters above Cutty’s showroom.
- The Temple of the Chained God is brainwashing select veterans and sleeper agents.
- Beneath Gallows Market lies an old Sednan altar, sealed but not silent.
