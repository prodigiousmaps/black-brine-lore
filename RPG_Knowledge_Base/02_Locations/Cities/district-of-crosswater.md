# Overview
Crosswater is the industrial lung of Black Brine—loud, grimy, and always working. Straddling the Daggerflow’s eastern bank just south of Salt Crown, it is where wood, steel, and sweat become ships, weapons, and coin. Tar, metal, and salt hang in the air while cranes groan overhead.  

# Geography
- Cobbled lanes between slanted buildings and stacked warehouses.  
- Dry docks housing half-gutted hulls.  
- Soot-blackened chimneys belching smoke.  
- Flood-prone alleys crusted with seaweed at high tide.  

# Notable Features
- **Dry Docks of Crosswater** – Constant clang of repairs; “where ships bleed and are reborn.”  
- **The Wet Bar** – Sunken two-level tavern catering to aquatic folk; half-submerged.  
- **String & Power** – Famous weaponsmiths, the feuding Gunderson brothers (bows vs. guns).  
- **Shipwright Guilds & Warehouses** – Legal and illicit goods flow through.  

# Demographics
Mostly working-class dockhands, smiths, and sailors; apprenticeships common. A few master shipwrights and weapon-crafters hold wealth and influence.  

# Culture & Daily Life
Rough but proud; loyalty measured in sweat and steel. Brawls over debts are as common as deals struck in taverns.  

# Reputation
Known for excellent shipwrights and custom weapons. Also infamous for smuggling tunnels, caches, and debts tied to gangs.  
“If Salt Crown is the heart, Crosswater is the clenched fist.”  

# Adventure Hooks
- Ghostly hammering haunts the dry docks at night.  
- Rival shipwrights sabotage builds before launch day.  
- Shipment of enchanted hardwood meant for the Council has gone missing—last seen here.
