# Overview
Blackmire squats in the low basin of Black Brine’s northeastern edge, a fetid sprawl of half-sunken alleys, leaning shanties, and broken boardwalks. Mist and moss choke the air, steeped in the smell of tar, rot, and stagnant water. It is where the city’s filth collects—runoff, secrets, and broken lives.

# Geography
- Flood-prone bog streets, stilted homes, and narrow canals  
- Crumbling docks on fetid inlets  
- Mangroves of the Mire Fen pressing into the district  
- Abandoned, flooded warehouses along the river  

# Notable Features
- **Miremarket** – Black market disguised as salvage bazaar.  
- **The Crooked Lantern** – Crumbling tavern, center of rumors and disappearances.  
- **Whisperer’s Hollow** – Old well filled with offerings to a swamp spirit.  
- **Foghouse Row** – Abandoned smuggler dens, now home to inhuman things.  
- **Black Brine Library** – Old chapel remade into a public library and meeting hall.  

# Demographics
Poor laborers, fisherfolk, fortune-tellers, and outcasts; transient, few stay by choice.  

# Government & Politics
Neglected by the Captain’s Council. Rule passes through bribes, threats, and gang deals. The Butchers are encroaching, raising tensions.  

# Economy
Salvage, smuggling, swampcraft, and odd herbs. Rumors of rare alchemical ingredients buried in the mire.  

# Culture & Daily Life
Superstitious, wary, but oddly festive. Secret moonless-night festivals, children wearing bone charms, and whispers offered to the fog.  

# Notable NPCs
- **Mister Blight** – Fixer with a blind eye and sharper tongue.  
- **Yurra the Mireborn** – Herbalist trading poisons and potions.  
- **Three-Tooth Mavin** – Gang boss, greasy ruler of Miremarket.  

# Adventure Hooks
- Vanishings tied to Foghouse Row.  
- Noble’s heir sheltered among swamp-dwellers.  
- Strange fungus spreads from Whisperer’s Hollow, rumored sentient.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- A forgotten portal to Sedna’s cult lies under the mire.  
- The swamp itself may be alive—or haunted.  
- Fog carries whispers, sometimes answering back.
