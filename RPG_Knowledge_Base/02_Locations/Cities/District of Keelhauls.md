# Keelhauls

## Overview
Keelhauls is the city’s rust-stained gut—the place where cargo is hauled, backs are broken, and blood washes into the sea. Home to the cheapest berths, the foulest grog, and the roughest crews, it’s the first place newcomers step ashore—and the last most corpses leave. Industrial, brutal, and always in motion.

## Geography
A sprawl of piers, cranes, warehouses, and rusted hulls along the southern edge of Black Brine. The river stinks of brine, fish rot, and fuel. Cobbled streets give way to mud and broken planks. The air is thick with shouting, seagulls, and the clang of work.

## Notable Features
- **The Low Berths**: Dockside moorings for ships too poor—or too wanted—for better quarters.
- **Rustgate**: Main customs checkpoint for goods coming from the sea into the city.
- **Fishbone Row**: A crooked street of salty taverns, fishmongers, debt collectors, and black market brokers.
- **The Sump**: A half-sunken warehouse converted into a fighting pit and gambling den.
- **Chain Wharf**: A secure zone used by official fleets and military supply lines.

## Demographics
Sailors, dockworkers, smugglers, fishmongers, exiles, and desperate souls. This is the working underbelly of Black Brine. Most residents live aboard their ships or in bunks above warehouses.

## Government & Politics
Officially patrolled by the Harbor Guard, but most order is enforced by gang pressure and dock bosses. The Butchers have strong influence here. Bribes are expected. Warnings come whispered.

## Economy
Keelhauls handles the city’s imports—grain, meat, tools, foreign goods, illegal cargo. Labor is cheap. Theft is common. Efficiency is bought in coin and intimidation.

## Culture & Daily Life
Brutal, fast-paced, and unforgiving. Everyone has a job or a racket. Rumors travel faster than ships. Fistfights settle disputes. The strongest rise, the weakest vanish.

## Notable NPCs
- **The Noose**: Brutal gang lord of the Butchers; runs Gentle Rest Inn and controls much of the local smuggling.
- **“Redcap” Grinley**: Veteran dock foreman with a mechanical arm and a grudge against nearly everyone.
- **Sister Fenn**: Sedna’s cult emissary trying (and failing) to bring spiritual order to the district.

## Adventure Hooks
- A mysterious cargo arrives sealed in black iron—no one knows who ordered it.
- The Noose is missing, and three gangs scramble to take his place.
- Something is dragging workers off the docks at night. Something… wet.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- Beneath the Sump lies a sunken smuggler’s vault sealed with ancient runes.
- Chain Wharf is being used to move cursed relics under cult orders.
- A hidden tunnel network beneath the docks leads into the bones of an ancient drowned city.
