# Overview
Keelhauls is the city’s rust-stained gut—the place where cargo is hauled, backs are broken, and blood washes into the sea. It is home to the cheapest berths, the foulest grog, and the roughest crews. For newcomers it’s the first step ashore; for corpses, often the last. Brutal, industrial, and always in motion.

# Geography
- Piers, cranes, warehouses, and rusted hulls along Black Brine’s southern edge.  
- River reeks of brine, fish rot, and fuel.  
- Cobbled streets dissolve into mud and broken planks.  
- Air filled with shouting, gulls, and the clang of iron.  

# Notable Features
- **The Low Berths** – Dockside moorings for poor or wanted ships.  
- **Rustgate** – Customs checkpoint for sea goods entering the city.  
- **Fishbone Row** – Street of taverns, fishmongers, debt collectors, and brokers.  
- **The Sump** – Half-sunken warehouse turned fighting pit and gambling den.  
- **Chain Wharf** – Secure mooring for official fleets and military supply.  

# Demographics
Sailors, dockworkers, smugglers, fishmongers, and desperate exiles. Most sleep aboard ships or in bunkhouses over warehouses.  

# Government & Politics
Officially patrolled by the Harbor Guard, but real order comes from gangs and dock bosses. The Butchers wield heavy influence. Bribes and whispered warnings are standard.  

# Economy
Handles Black Brine’s imports: grain, meat, tools, foreign luxuries, and contraband. Labor is cheap, theft common, and efficiency purchased in coin or blood.  

# Culture & Daily Life
Fast, brutal, and unforgiving. Everyone has a hustle. Rumors spread like wildfire. Disputes are solved with fists. The strong thrive, the weak vanish.  

# Notable NPCs
- **The Noose** – Butchers’ gang lord; runs Gentle Rest Inn and controls smuggling.  
- **“Redcap” Grinley** – Dock foreman with a mechanical arm and a grudge.  
- **Sister Fenn** – Cult emissary of Sedna, trying and failing to bring order.  

# Adventure Hooks
- A mysterious cargo in black iron arrives with no known sender.  
- The Noose has gone missing; three gangs scramble to claim his seat.  
- Something wet drags workers off the docks at night.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- The Sump hides a sunken smuggler’s vault bound by runes.  
- Chain Wharf moves cursed relics for Sedna’s cult.  
- Hidden tunnels connect the docks to an ancient drowned city.
