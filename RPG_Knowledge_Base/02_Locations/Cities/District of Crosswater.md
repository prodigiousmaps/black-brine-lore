# Crosswater District

## Overview
Crosswater is the industrial lung of Black Brine—loud, grimy, and always working. Straddling the Daggerflow’s eastern bank just south of the Salt Crown’s wealth, Crosswater is where wood, steel, and sweat become ships, weapons, and coin. The air stinks of tar, metal, salt, and ambition. It’s a place for dockhands, smiths, sailors, and the ones who fix what others break.

## Geography
Cobbled lanes wind between slanted buildings, stacked warehouses, and soot-blackened chimneys. Dry docks chew on half-gutted hulls while cranes swing loads overhead like drunken giants. The lower alleys flood during high tide, leaving seaweed crusted on doorsteps.

## Notable Locations
- **Dry Docks of Crosswater** – "Where ships bleed and are reborn." The clang of repairs never stops.
- **The Wet Bar** – A sunken, two-level tavern catering to aquatic folk and surface-dwellers alike. The first floor is submerged; the second’s half-drenched. Social hub for sea races and eccentric captains.
- **String & Power** – Legendary weaponsmithing shop and home to the feuding Gunderson brothers. Half bowyer, half gunsmith.
- **Assorted Warehouses & Shipwright Guilds** – Most of Black Brine’s imported goods pass through here, some legal, some less so.

## Culture & Society
Crosswater's people value **craft, coin, and quiet strength**. Most are working-class, though a few shipwrights and weapon-crafters have grown wealthy. The district is **rough but proud**, where loyalty is measured in sweat and steel. Apprenticeships are common, and so are tavern brawls over unpaid debts.

## Reputation
Crosswater is known for **industrious labor, excellent shipwrights, and the best custom weapons** in the city. But it also hides smuggling tunnels, weapons caches, and more than a few debts owed to unsavory sorts. Some say if Salt Crown is the heart, Crosswater is the clenched fist.

## Rumors & Adventure Hooks
- An old shipwright swears a ghost haunts the dry docks at night—hammering when no one's there.
- Rival shipwrights are sabotaging each other’s builds before launch day.
- A shipment of enchanted hardwood meant for the Council has gone missing—last seen in Crosswater.
