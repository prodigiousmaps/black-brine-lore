# Overview
Salt Crown clings to the jagged shoreline like a rusted barnacle, half-rotted and wholly dangerous. A district of leaning taverns, secret stairways, and alleys that turn back on themselves, it is home to smugglers, gamblers, storytellers, and killers with a grin. It’s where the stories start, the coin changes hands, and the trouble always finds you—if you don’t find it first.

# Geography
- Crumbling bluff above southern docks.  
- Tide-battered piers and reef-side caverns.  
- Uneven stone stairs, rope bridges, and stacked driftwood towers.  
- Basalt outcroppings and ancient ruins jutting through streets.  

# Notable Features
- **Sinker’s Curiosities** – A repurposed sloop turned curiosity shop of strange magical items and dangerous oddities. Home of the enigmatic shopkeeper Sinker.  
- **The Gentle Rest Inn** – A raucous tavern and torture house run by The Noose and the Butchers. Deals are struck here—in blood.  
- **The Bonewalk** – A narrow pier made from shipwreck timbers and whale bone. Fishermen say it groans when a storm is near.  

# Demographics
Lower-class laborers, criminals, dockworkers, exiles, wanderers, and smugglers. Outsiders are common, but none remain unmarked for long.  

# Government & Politics
Salt Crown runs on grit, gold, and grudges. The Captain’s Council claims authority, but true power belongs to the gangs—especially the Butchers under The Noose. Informants of every faction mingle here, and tavern deals can ripple across the city.  

# Economy
Smuggling, stolen goods, illicit alchemy, and dockside labor. Salt Crown is Black Brine’s busiest channel for goods—legal or otherwise.  

# Culture & Daily Life
Rough music, dice games, heavy smoke. Secrets are worth more than silver, curses are believed more than gods, and only the sea and a sharp knife are trusted.  

# Notable NPCs
- **Sinker** – Half-mad, half-genius shopkeeper of Sinker’s Curiosities.  
- **The Noose** – Butchers’ gang lord; brutal and theatrical in punishment.  

# Adventure Hooks
- A cursed item from Sinker’s shop goes missing and haunts the district.  
- Rumors of The Noose’s death spark a bloody power vacuum.  
- A shipwreck unearthed by tides reveals a secret vault, sparking conflict.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- A tunnel beneath The Gentle Rest leads into the ancient reef caves.  
- The Butchers may be conspiring with outsiders to undermine Governor Rosy.  
- Salt Crown is built on a forgotten temple—its altar still whispers at night.
