# Overview
Mistwalk is the nerve center of Black Brine—equal parts gilded theater and dagger’s edge. It is where captains rule, cults whisper, and merchants trade in blood and coin. Fog swirls through perfumed streets, thick with incense, secrets, and the weight of eyes watching from every balcony.

# Geography
- Tiered terraces overlooking the Black Brine River  
- Ornate bridges and cobbled plazas  
- Upper levels: opulent and maze-like  
- Lower alleys: shrines, markets, and informants  
- Fog lingers heavier here than anywhere else in the city  

# Notable Features
- **City Hull** – Grounded galleon serving as fortress and government hall  
- **Gallows Market** – Multicolored plaza of fashion, shadowed by the Chained God temple  
- **The Captain’s Club** – Private den for gambling, music, and deals among elites  
- **Cutty’s Blades** – Luxury weapons boutique and dueling hall; Widowmakers fleet HQ above  
- **Temple of the Chained God** – Towering cathedral of foreign faith, feeding and housing retired pirates, quietly indoctrinating them  

# Demographics
Wealthy captains, cultists, diplomats, spies, and retired pirates. Bureaucrats and priesthood anchor the district. Beneath the finery, paranoia blooms.  

# Government & Politics
The Captain’s Council rules from City Hull, but friction with Sedna’s cult and the Chained God temple runs deep. Mistwalk is the stage where Black Brine’s true power struggles play out.  

# Economy
Trade, extortion, information, and control. Guilds and factions negotiate with coin, blades, or curses.  

# Culture & Daily Life
Perfumed feasts, dueling schools, and shrines contrast with alleys steeped in blood and incense. Masks of wealth hide fear and cruelty.  

# Notable NPCs
- **Gun Deck Rosy** – Sedna’s high priestess and governor of Black Brine  
- **Father Karr** – Serene-faced priest of the Chained God, smiling too softly  
- **Cutty** – Merchant-duelist, owner of Cutty’s Blades  

# Adventure Hooks
- A captain’s duel ends with a vanishing—no blood, no body, only fog  
- A veteran cared for by the Chained God temple speaks in tongues, then vanishes  
- A secret vault under Cutty’s Blades can only be opened by a duel  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- The Widowmakers fleet plots assassination from above Cutty’s Blades  
- The Chained God temple brainwashes veterans into sleeper agents  
- A sealed Sednan altar lies beneath Gallows Market
