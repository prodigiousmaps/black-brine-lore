# Overview
Where the salt Brine River meets the freshwater Black tributary, the waters form a natural divide in salinity, culture, and superstition.

# Geography
- Northern flow: salty, tied to the Maelstrom and Sedna’s favor.  
- Southern flow: freshwater, feeding settlements and trade.  
- Junction creates eerie visual divides of black and clear water.  

# Cultural Impact
- Saltwater pirates scorn freshwater “soft hands.”  
- “South Water Rum” prized from distilleries south of the junction.  
- Offerings to Sedna cast into the salty side.  
- Pirates refuse to sleep near the river on black-water nights.  

# Strategic Role
- Junction is a smuggling ground.  
- Red Chain Bridge guards the crossing.  
- Poisoning the southern tributary would be devastating in war.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- A ghostly black ship haunts the junction.  
- Council avoids settling the southern bank for fear of Sedna’s wrath.
