# The Code of Black Brine

**The Code of Black Brine**

Black Brine is a pirate stronghold, but **even pirates need rules**—not for justice, but for **survival**. The **Council of Captains** enforces a **simple but brutal code**, ensuring order in a city filled with cutthroats, thieves, and fugitives.

### **The Five Laws of Black Brine**

1. **The Island Stays Secret**

    - No one speaks of **Sedna’s waters, Black Brine’s location, or the ways to find it**—not in port, not in letters, not even in drunken whispers.

    - Those who **break this silence** are labeled **Breachers**—and **no Breacher leaves the island alive**.

2. **The Right to Keep What You Take**

    - **Theft is legal—until the owner catches you.** If you steal, be ready to **fight for it**.

    - If **you are caught and cannot defend your prize**, you owe a **payment of flesh**—a **finger, an ear, or an eye**, depending on the crime.

3. **No Blood Without Cause**

    - **Murder without reason** is outlawed—**kill in a duel, in revenge, or in battle, but not without cause**.

    - Those who **kill without justification** are **fed to the sea**.

4. **Debts Must Be Paid**

    - **A man without honor is a dead man.** If you take a loan, you pay it.

    - If you **run from debt**, the Council will send **the Black Marks**—enforcers who **carve the debt into your flesh before throwing you in the Maw**.

5. **The Captains Rule the Waves**

    - The **Council of Captains is the only law that matters**.

    - **To defy them is to lose the right to sail**, and a pirate who cannot sail is **no pirate at all**.

### **Punishments & Enforcement**

**Breaking the Code results in swift and brutal justice**, often delivered by **the Red Chains (Bridge Guards), the Black Marks (Debt Enforcers), or the Council's Hand (Executioners).**

- **Breach of Secrecy → Execution** (Fed to the Maelstrom, hanged from the Red Chain Bridge, or sent into the jungle to be “claimed” by Sedna).

- **Petty Theft → Maiming** (Fingers, ears, or an eye taken, depending on the crime).

- **Murder Without Cause → Thrown to the Sea** (If the sharks don’t take you, the Maw will).

- **Unpaid Debt → Branding or the Black Marks** (Carved with tally marks of the unpaid sum, then left to die or work it off).

- **Defying the Council → Exile or worse** (Stripped of ship, rank, and respect, and cast into the sea—or worse, delivered to **Gun Deck Rosy**).

### **The Ultimate Code of Silence**

**"The Sea Forgets, So Must We."**

This is the **unbreakable law of Black Brine**—the city’s **location, defenses, and safe passages must never be spoken of beyond its waters**.

Every sailor, merchant, and commoner in Black Brine understands this:

- **If the world learns where we are, we are lost.**

- **If you tell, you die.**

- **If you ask too much, you vanish.**

Even those **born on the island** must **never question how ships arrive or leave**.

It is said that **when a child is old enough to understand words, they are told only this: "The sea forgets, so must we."**

### **How This Code Shapes Black Brine’s People**

- **Fear & Loyalty:** Even the city’s **non-sailors—smiths, traders, and barkeeps—live by this rule**.

- **Silent Knowledge:** If an outsider asks **too many questions**, they are simply **never seen again**.

- **The Unspoken Oath:** There is **no ceremony, no contract—only the understanding that breaking the code is a death sentence**.
