# Overview
The Code is Black Brine’s brutal law of survival, enforced by the Council of Captains. Pirates live by it—or die by it.

# The Five Laws
1. **The Island Stays Secret** – Breakers are executed.  
2. **The Right to Keep What You Take** – Theft is legal until contested. Losers pay in flesh.  
3. **No Blood Without Cause** – Murder only in duel, revenge, or battle.  
4. **Debts Must Be Paid** – Run from debt and the Black Marks carve your flesh.  
5. **The Captains Rule the Waves** – Defiance means exile or worse.  

# Punishments
- Secrecy breach → execution.  
- Petty theft → maiming.  
- Murder without cause → fed to the sea.  
- Unpaid debt → branding, maiming, or death.  
- Defying council → exile, loss of ship, or execution.  

# Ultimate Code
“The Sea Forgets, So Must We.” Silence of location and secrets is unbreakable law.  

# Cultural Impact
- Every child is raised on the Code.  
- Outsiders who ask too much vanish.  
- Survival depends on honoring the unspoken oath.
