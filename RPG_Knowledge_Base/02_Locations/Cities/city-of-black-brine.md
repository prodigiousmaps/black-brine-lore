# Overview
Black Brine is the infamous pirate city on Sedna’s eastern shore, ten miles south of the confluence of the Black and Brine Rivers. Shrouded in mist and ruled by cutthroat politics, it is both a stronghold and prison for those who dwell within. Power shifts like the tide, always at a cost.

# Geography
- Built along the Black Brine River, anchored by docks and districts that spill into jungle ruins.  
- Mist and reefs surround the island, isolating the city.  
- The Red Chain Bridge spans the river, scarred and haunted by legend.  

# Districts
- **Salt Crown (mercantile):** Elegant yet dangerous center of trade and intrigue. Nobles and criminals mingle here.  
- **Mistwalk (civic/religious):** Political and spiritual hub; home to City Hull, Gallows Market, and the Temple of the Chained God.  
- **KeelHauls (industrial/port):** Stinking docks, ship berths, and warehouses.  
- **Little Sedna (residential/religious):** Lower-class housing built into ancient ruins; Temple of Sedna stands here.  
- **Salt Crown Shores (mixed):** River’s edge dockside; trade, curiosities, and the Charter House.  

# Landmarks
- **City Hull (governmental):** A grounded war galleon turned fortress; seat of the Captain’s Council.  
- **Red Chain Bridge (geographic):** Stone span scarred by wars, now haunted.  
- **Temple of Sedna (religious):** A tidal cave temple to the deep goddess, flooding with the tides.  
- **Temple of the Chained God (religious):** Mainland faith foothold; charitable front for indoctrination.  
- **The Broadside Inn (tavern/bathhouse):** Once a riverside temple; now a den of revelry with geothermal pools.  

# Factions
- **Captain’s Council:** Pirate lords and faction leaders governing city and fleets.  
- **Sedna’s Cult:** Devotees of the deep goddess, enforcing law with fear and sacrifice.  
- **Independent Pirate Fleets:** Semi-loyal crews with their own agendas, some represented on the council.  
- **The Butchers:** Brutal syndicate led by the Noose; extortion and smuggling in Salt Crown.  

# Notable Features
- **Black Brine River:** Lifeblood of the city, joining two mighty rivers.  
- **Perpetual Mist:** Natural defense, veil of superstition.  
- **Pirate Fleets:** Competing powers, shifting loyalties.  
- **Challenge Coins:** Enchanted tokens required to navigate the mist-choked reefs.  

# Culture & Tone
Dark, nautical, grimy, and arcane. Power comes with a price, alliances shift like the tide, and survival is earned through blood, cunning, or sacrifice.

# Adventure Hooks
- A Nameless Watcher stands nightly on the Red Chain Bridge, silent and ominous.  
- Rumors whisper of a vault beneath City Hull, sealed since the last island war.  
- Sedna stirs beneath her temple; the tides rise with her unrest.  
- A missing Challenge Coin may collapse fragile fleet alliances.
