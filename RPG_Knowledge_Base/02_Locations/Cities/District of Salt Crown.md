# Salt Crown

## Overview
Salt Crown clings to the jagged shoreline like a rusted barnacle, half-rotted and wholly dangerous. A district of leaning taverns, secret stairways, and alleys that turn back on themselves, it is home to smugglers, gamblers, storytellers, and killers with a grin. It’s where the stories start, the coin changes hands, and the trouble always finds you—if you don’t find it first.

## Geography
Salt Crown sprawls across a crumbling bluff above the southern docks, sloping down into tide-battered piers and reef-side caverns. The terrain is uneven—stone stairs rise and fall with no pattern, buildings are stacked like driftwood towers, and rope bridges sway in the salt wind. Basalt outcroppings and ancient ruins poke up through the city like bones refusing burial.

## Notable Features
- **Sinker’s Curiosities**: A repurposed sloop now filled with strange magical items and dangerous oddities. Home of the enigmatic shopkeeper Sinker.
- **The Gentle Rest Inn**: A raucous tavern and torture house run by The Noose and his gang, The Butchers. Deals are struck here—in blood.
- **The Bonewalk**: A narrow pier made from shipwreck timbers and whale bone. Fishermen say it groans when a storm is near.

## Demographics
Mostly lower-class laborers, criminals, dockworkers, exiles, and wanderers. A haven for outsiders, but no one stays unmarked for long. Locals have sharp eyes, sharper blades, and no interest in your sob story.

## Government & Politics
Salt Crown operates on grit, gold, and grudges. The Captain’s Council pretends to rule here, but it’s the gangs who truly hold power—especially the Butchers, led by The Noose. Informants from every faction circulate through the taverns, and deals struck here often ripple across the whole city.

## Economy
Built on smuggling, stolen goods, illicit alchemy, and dockside work. Salt Crown sees the most goods flow in and out of Black Brine—both legal and otherwise. The locals take their cut, or take your tongue.

## Culture & Daily Life
Rough music, dice games, and endless smoke. Here, secrets are more valuable than silver, and everything has a price. Locals believe in curses more than gods and trust only the sea and a good knife.

## Notable NPCs
- **Sinker**: Half-mad, half-genius, all dangerous. His shop is a riddle wrapped in barnacles.
- **The Noose**: Brutal gang lord with a flair for punishment. Rules the Butchers with iron cleavers and cruel precision.

## Adventure Hooks
- A cursed item from Sinker’s shop goes missing and begins haunting the district.
- A power vacuum emerges as The Noose is rumored dead—though his body hasn’t been found.
- A shipwreck unearthed by the tides reveals a secret vault, sparking a bloody race for its contents.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- A hidden passage beneath The Gentle Rest connects to the ancient reef tunnels.
- The Butchers may be working with outside forces to undermine Rosy’s control of the docks.
- Salt Crown was built atop a forgotten temple—some say its altar still whispers at night.
