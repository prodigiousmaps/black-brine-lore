# Government

### **The Council of Captains**

- The **eight most powerful and prosperous captains** make up the ruling body.

- Likely each has their own fleet, resources, and strongholds within or beyond Black Brine.

- They govern by a mix of tradition, strength, and negotiation, with alliances shifting frequently.

### **Governor "Gun Deck" Rosy**

- A **female tiefling**, suggesting she may have an infernal heritage that adds to her mystique.

- Her nickname **"Gun Deck"** implies expertise in naval warfare, possibly a pioneer in gunpowder tactics.

- As an elected leader, she must balance the **volatile ambitions** of the captains while maintaining Black Brineâ€™s prosperity.
