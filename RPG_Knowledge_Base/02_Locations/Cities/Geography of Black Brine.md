# Geography of Black Brine

### **Black Brine – City Geography & Key Locations**

Black Brine is a **sprawling pirate stronghold** built along the **river delta** on the **island of Sedna**, hidden by **ever-present mist** and **treacherous reefs**. The city is a mix of **rickety docks, repurposed ship hulls, stone ruins, and pirate estates**, all built into the **rugged, jungle-choked coastline**.

#### **City Layout**

- **The Dagger Docks** – The **primary port**, a maze of **haphazard piers, gangplanks, and ship hulls** repurposed into taverns, smuggler dens, and storehouses.

- **The Keelhauls** – A rough slum where **pirates without a crew** or **disgraced captains** scrape by. Home to **cutthroats, informants, and desperate souls**.

- **The Salt Crown** – The wealthiest part of Black Brine, where the **most powerful captains** have estates. The **Council Hall of Captains** is here.

- **The Gallows Market** – The central bazaar, named for the **hanging corpses of thieves**, filled with merchants **selling stolen goods, exotic wares, and illegal magic**.

- **The Velvet Hammer** – A high-end gambling hall and brothel, run by the **Thieves’ Guild** of the same name. Deals in **secrets as much as coin**.

- **The Rusted Anchor** – A notorious tavern where pirates **plot their next score**, sell **stolen goods**, and get **blind drunk**.

- **The Reefgate** – The **only safe entrance** into Black Brine’s harbor, protected by **magical wards and hidden cannons**.

- **The Shrine of Sedna** – A **dark, salt-stained temple** where **devout followers of Sedna** make sacrifices. Overseen by **fanatic priests**.

- **The Shipbreaker’s Yard** – A massive graveyard of shipwrecks, used as **raw material for new construction** or as **hiding places for illicit deals**.

- **The Black Mire** – The city’s **rotting underbelly**, a place of **bogs, forgotten ruins, and foul-smelling canals**.

#### **Rupert Richthorn’s Tower**

- **Located west of town**, in a **forbidden, mist-choked region**.

- Its **arcane presence disturbs the locals**, and **few dare venture near it**.

- **Strange lights, eerie sounds, and whispers** emanate from the area.

#### **Additional Ideas**

- **Secret Tunnels & Smuggler Routes** – A **network of tunnels** and **hidden canals** run **beneath the city**, used for **smuggling, assassinations, and disappearances**.

- **The Mistwalk** – A treacherous **cliffside path** leading to **hidden pirate coves** outside the main city.

- **The Wrecked Fleet** – A **cluster of ruined ships**, partially sunk but **still occupied by outcasts**.
