# Blackmire

## Overview
Blackmire squats in the low basin of the city’s northeastern edge, a fetid stretch of half-sunken alleys, leaning shanties, and broken boardwalks. Choked by mist and moss, it smells of rotting wood, tar, and slow decay. Here, the city’s filth pools—runoff, rumors, and the broken dreams of the desperate.

## Geography
Low-lying and flood-prone, Blackmire is a tangle of boggy streets, stilted homes, and narrow canals. Crumbling docks edge fetid inlets. Old mangroves of the Mire Fen marshes claw at the edge of the district like they’re trying to pull it back into the swamp. Abandoned and flooded warehouses choke the banks of the river.

## Notable Features
- **Miremarket**: A black market disguised as a salvage bazaar.
- **The Crooked Lantern**: A crumbling tavern known for rumors and disappearances.
- **Whisperer’s Hollow**: An old well filled with offerings to an unnamed spirit of the swamp.
- **Foghouse Row**: A cluster of abandoned smuggler dens, now home to something… not entirely human.
- **Black Brine Library**: An ancient chapel referbished into an extensive library and public gathering space.

## Demographics
Mostly poor laborers, outcasts, fortune-tellers, and fisherfolk of the northern Black Brine River. Few stay here long by choice.

## Government & Politics
Though technically under the Captain’s Council’s control, Blackmire is often left to govern itself. Bribes, threats, and shifting gang alliances keep order—barely. The Butchers have begun to encroach, and tensions run high.

## Economy
Salvage, smuggling, odd herbs and swampcraft. The district thrives on what others throw away. There are rumors of rare alchemical components buried in the muck.

## Culture & Daily Life
Superstitious, tight-lipped, and strangely festive. Locals host wild, secretive festivals on moonless nights. Children wear bone charms and whisper to things in the fog.

## Notable NPCs
- **Mister Blight**: A local fixer with a blind eye and sharper tongue.
- **Yurra the Mireborn**: A reclusive herbalist who trades in poisons and potions.
- **Three-Tooth Mavin**: Gang boss who runs Miremarket with greasy hands.

## Adventure Hooks
- A rash of disappearances linked to Foghouse Row.
- A noble’s heir fled here, protected by swamp-dwellers.
- A strange fungus spreads from the Whisperer’s Hollow—rumored to be sentient.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- An ancient portal sleeps beneath the mire, once used by Sedna’s original cult.
- The swamp itself may be alive, or at least haunted.
- The Blackmire fog carries more than moisture—some say it whispers back.
