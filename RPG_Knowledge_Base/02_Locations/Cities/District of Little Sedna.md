# Little Sedna

## Overview
Little Sedna is a quiet, brooding corner of Black Brine built atop the moss-covered bones of a civilization long drowned. The district blends ancient stone ruins with humble modern dwellings, winding between weather-worn statues and half-sunken archways. It is a place of reverence, mystery, and forgotten power.

## Geography
Set back from the Black Brine River, Little Sedna rests at a slightly higher elevation on the west side of the city. The land slopes gently toward the temple cliffs, where caves open to the sea. Narrow streets and stairways weave between old stone foundations and newer timber homes. The air is heavy with sea mist and incense.

## Notable Features
- **Temple of Sedna**: A massive, tidal cave temple used for ritual worship of the goddess of the deep. Accessible only at low tide. Rumored to connect to ancient, flooded catacombs.
- **Old Walls**: Massive blocks of stone from a long-dead civilization form the backbone of the district. No one remembers who built them.
- **Tide Shrines**: Small household altars to Sedna are common, decorated with shells, bones, and driftwood.

## Demographics
Primarily fisherfolk, cult initiates, widows of sailors, and reclusive artisans. The pace is slow, the speech is soft, and superstition runs deep.

## Government & Politics
The Temple of Sedna wields significant religious and political influence here, with Priestess-in-Red Nema unofficially running the district. The Captain’s Council rarely interferes unless provoked.

## Economy
Subsistence fishing, shrine offerings, and modest crafts like net-making, bone carving, and salt curing. Coin is rare but loyalty and favors are currency enough.

## Culture & Daily Life
Devout and somber. Residents follow the tides, attend ritual offerings, and observe sacred silences. Festivals are rare, but the Moon-Turning is a solemn and eerie affair marked by dream-walks and oceanic trances.

## Notable NPCs
- **Nema, Priestess-in-Red**: Sedna’s voice in Little Sedna. Calm, severe, and draped in coral-threaded robes. Said to weep blood on stormy nights.
- **Old Marrit**: Local bone carver and unofficial historian. Whispers the stones remember, if you ask right.

## Adventure Hooks
- Strange lights seen flickering in the flooded lower caverns beneath the temple.
- A child speaks in tongues after sleepwalking into a sealed shrine.
- A drowned priest’s ghost appears to warn of a rising tide that never comes.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- The Temple of Sedna houses a drowned relic said to be a piece of Sedna herself. It pulses when the moon is high.
- Forgotten passages beneath the old stonework may lead to pre-flood catacombs—or worse.
