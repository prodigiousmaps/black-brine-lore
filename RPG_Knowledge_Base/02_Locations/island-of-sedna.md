# Overview
The Island of Sedna is the cursed, mist-shrouded heart of the Mother of Mists archipelago. Said to be the domain of the forgotten goddess Sedna, it is wrapped in legends of blood, betrayal, and the sea. Treacherous reefs and eternal fog conceal it, and the river that bisects the island is regarded as the last boundary of sanity before plunging into the wilderness.

# Geography
- **Black Brine River**: Where the freshwater Black River from the west meets the Brine River from the east; serves as a spiritual and cultural boundary.
- **East Sedna**: Populated and cultivated; home to Black Brine city, fishing coves, and highlands.
- **West Sedna**: Forbidden jungle, ruins, shrines, volcanic peaks; cursed and unexplored.
- **Misty Shores**: Reef-choked coasts in eternal fog, nearly impassable without magical guidance.
- **Volcanic Peak**: Dormant but rumored to hold fire spirits, relics, and treasure.
- **Eastern Highlands**: Sparse settlements of hermits and cultists on storm-battered cliffs.
- **Southern Trade Post**: Hidden pirate and smuggler market.
- **Shrouded Grotto**: Secret cave network bound to Sedna’s magic.

# Notable Features
- **Forbidden West**: Sedna’s shrines, lost expeditions, and voices in the mist; the land resists intrusion.
- **Jungle Ruins**: Moss-covered temples and altars of a vanished people, cursed relics, and undead guardians.
- **Eternal Mist**: Divine curse or magical ward tied to Sedna’s dominion.
- **Ghost Ships**: Crewless vessels that appear without warning, hunting intruders.

# Culture & Lore
- The river is a sacred boundary; no one from Black Brine ventures west.
- Children grow up on stories of Sedna’s wrath and jungle shrines.
