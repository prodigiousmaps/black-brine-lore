# Island of Sedna

## Overview
The Island of Sedna is the cursed, mist-shrouded heart of the Mother of Mists archipelago. Said to be the domain of the forgotten goddess Sedna, it is wrapped in legends of blood, betrayal, and the sea. Treacherous reefs and thick fog protect it from outsiders, and the river that bisects the island is regarded as the last boundary of sanity before plunging into the wilderness. Only the bold or the mad venture west.

## Geography

### The River
- **Name**: Black Brine River  
- **Origin**: Formed where the freshwater Black River from the western jungles meets the saltwater Brine River  
- **Significance**: Acts as a spiritual and cultural barrier between civilized East Sedna and the Forbidden West

### Key Regions
- **East Sedna**: Populated and cultivated; home to the city of Black Brine, fishing coves, and highlands
- **West Sedna**: Unexplored jungle, ruins, volcanic peaks, sacred shrines; considered cursed
- **Misty Shores**: Reef-choked coasts wrapped in eternal fog; inaccessible without magical or expert navigation
- **Volcanic Peak**: Possibly dormant; rumored to hold fire spirits, treasure hoards, and ancient power
- **Eastern Highlands**: Storm-battered cliffs and sparse settlements of hermits and cultists
- **Southern Trade Post**: A hidden marketplace used by pirates and smugglers
- **Shrouded Grotto**: A secretive cave network tied to Sedna’s power, hidden beneath cliffs or mountains
