# Overview
A lavish multi-tiered residence carved from an old artillery barracks. Cannons now serve as décor in courtyards where captains and quartermasters buy prestige as much as privacy.

# Geography
Uphill from the Salt Crown market with balconies over the harbor; fortified timber-and-stone frame.

# Notable Features
- Private guard & doorman (retired bosun “Crank”)
- Rooftop watch deck for spotting fleet arrivals
- Courtyard well; cannon-fountain centerpiece

# Demographics
Successful pirates, retired smugglers, wealthy merchants tied to fleet politics.

# Culture & Daily Life
Quiet competition in ostentation; gossip spreads balcony-to-balcony. Duels banned on premises.

# Secrets (DM Only)
A panic room from the barracks era connects to a hidden tunnel. Crank’s “logs” of comings/goings may be security—or blackmail.

# Adventure Hooks
- A resident vanishes from a locked suite.
- A jewel goes missing during a rooftop gala.
- The cannon-fountain fires spectral rounds at midnight.
