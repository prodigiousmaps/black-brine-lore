# House of Questions

## Overview
A brooding, stone-faced building in Mistwalk known more by whispers than signage, the House of Questions is the investigative arm of the Captains' Council. Each ruling fleet appoints one inquisitor to serve here, forming a dangerous and politically tangled alliance of spies, judges, and executioners. Citizens dread their knock. Rivals fear their dossiers.

## Role in Society
The House of Questions exists to **uncover treason, corruption, conspiracy, and crimes** that threaten the stability of Black Brine. They answer only to the Captains’ Council, and their reach extends into every district, guild, and ship.

## Inquisitors
Each inquisitor reflects the temperament of their fleet:
- **Brutal enforcers**, **honey-tongued schemers**, **torture artists**, and **quiet ghosts** have all served here.
- They operate independently but frequently clash—politically and physically.
- Their loyalty is split between their **appointing captain** and the **interests of the city**, creating a powder keg of shifting alliances.

## Culture & Reputation
- **Feared and Respected** – Even captains tread lightly when the House is involved.
- **Shrouded in Mystery** – Files are sealed, interrogations are private, and few return unchanged.
- **Politically Volatile** – Inquisitors investigate each other as often as they do criminals.

## Structure
- **Interrogation Chambers** – Soundproofed, rune-locked rooms where truth is twisted out.
- **The Ledger Vault** – A secure archive of files, testimonies, and blackmail material.
- **Observation Gallery** – Upper-level viewing windows, where rival inquisitors watch interrogations for leverage.
- **The Stone Court** – A bleak, open chamber for hearings too dangerous for the streets.

## Adventure Hooks
- A rogue inquisitor is conducting unsanctioned interrogations tied to an unknown agenda.
- The party is accused of sedition and must prove innocence—or survive the alternative.
- A Council captain wants their inquisitor replaced. Quietly.
