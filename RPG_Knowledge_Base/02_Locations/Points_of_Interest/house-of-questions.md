# Overview
A brooding, stone-faced building in Mistwalk known more by whispers than signage, the House of Questions is the investigative arm of the Captain’s Council. Each ruling fleet appoints one inquisitor, creating a dangerous alliance of spies, judges, and executioners. Citizens dread their knock; rivals fear their dossiers.

# Role in Society
The House uncovers treason, corruption, conspiracy, and crimes threatening Black Brine’s stability. They answer only to the Council, extending their reach into every district, guild, and fleet.

# Inquisitors
- Appointed by each ruling fleet; loyalty split between fleet and city.  
- Brutal enforcers, honey-tongued schemers, torture artists, and quiet ghosts all serve here.  
- Known to clash politically and physically—even investigating each other.
