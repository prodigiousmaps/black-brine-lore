# Sinker's Curiosity Shop

### **Sinker’s Curiosity Shop – Black Brine’s Most Unusual Emporium**

A **floating shop built inside the gutted hull of an old ship**, **half-sunken in the shallows** of Black Brine’s harbor. The crooked masts serve as **hanging racks for strange trinkets**, and the entire structure is kept afloat by **patched-together pontoons, barnacle-crusted beams, and a web of rope bridges**. It looks **like it should have collapsed into the sea long ago**, but somehow, it remains standing.

Inside, the shop is a **maze of stacked crates, dusty shelves, and hanging charms**—a **chaotic but mesmerizing** collection of **rare artifacts, cursed trinkets, and forgotten relics**. Dim lanterns cast eerie **green and blue light**, revealing **bizarre curios from across Faerûn and beyond**.

### **Notable Items in Sinker’s Curiosity Shop**

- **The Skull of a Long-Dead Oracle** – Whispers prophecies, but only to those who know the right question.

- **A Harpoon of Black Ice** – It never melts, and wounds made by it never fully heal.

- **The "Endless" Spyglass** – When looked through, it sometimes shows **distant lands—or distant times**.

- **A Bottled Storm** – A swirling **miniature hurricane trapped in a bottle**, rumored to unleash its fury when uncorked.

- **A Mirror Wrapped in Chains** – Refuses to show a reflection, **unless fed a drop of blood**.

### **Sinker – The Shop’s Eccentric Proprietor**

- **Race**: ??? (Appears Human, but no one is sure)

- **Appearance**: **Hunched, skeletal thin**, with **patchwork leather robes** covered in **stitched-together runes**. His eyes are **mismatched—one cloudy white, the other like a cat’s**. His **hands are permanently ink-stained**, and **his fingernails are carved with tiny sigils**.

- **Personality**: Speaks in **riddles and half-truths**, rarely gives a **straight answer**. **Polite but unsettling**, as if he **knows things he shouldn’t**.

- **Rumors About Sinker**:

    - **He doesn’t sleep.**

    - **He’s been running this shop for over 100 years.**

    - **He was once a pirate, but he angered Sedna and was cursed to never sail again.**

    - **He can smell lies, and sometimes, he already knows what you’re going to ask.**

    - **He collects secrets as much as objects, and he always knows what’s happening in Black Brine.**

- **Payment Methods**: He accepts **gold, favors, secrets, and souls**—sometimes all at once.

### **Other Details About Sinker’s Shop**

- **It’s Bigger on the Inside** – The interior doesn’t **match the size of the ship hull**, leading some to suspect **extra-dimensional magic**.

- **It Moves** – While usually docked in the **Dagger Docks**, it sometimes **vanishes and appears elsewhere in Black Brine**.

- **The Door Locks on Its Own** – Some customers claim that once inside, they **couldn’t leave until they made a deal**.

### **Potential Story Hooks**

- **A Buyer for a Dangerous Item** – Sinker has something **too powerful to keep**, but **too dangerous to sell**—and he needs someone **brave (or foolish) enough to take it elsewhere**.

- **The Secret Room** – A backroom in Sinker’s shop **no one has ever seen inside**—what’s he hiding?

- **A Curse Lifted—For a Price** – Someone in the party is **cursed**, and Sinker knows how to **fix it… but at what cost?**
