# City Hull

## Overview
Once a mighty galleon that ruled the seas, City Hull now looms like a barnacled crown in the heart of Mistwalk. Run aground generations ago and fused into the bones of the city, its warped decks and iron-reinforced hull have become the nerve center of Black Brine’s twisted politics. It is both seat of power and temple to fear—where decrees are issued, sacrifices are made, and enemies vanish.

## Geography
Moored permanently in the center of a wide, cobbled plaza in Mistwalk, the hull rises three stories high, blackened by salt, smoke, and time. Rope bridges, plank walkways, and coral-reinforced gunports wind through its skeletal rigging. From its tallest mast, banners of violet and gold snap in the briny wind.

## Notable Features
- **Gun Deck Court**: Where trials—real or theatrical—are held beneath the glare of torchlight and cultic idols.
- **The Vault**: A hidden chamber beneath the keel said to hold cursed relics, ancient texts, and enough coin to start a war.
- **War Room**: Headquarters of the Captain’s Council, lined with maps, naval tokens, and bitter secrets.
- **Cathedral Deck**: Repurposed temple space devoted to Sedna, with rituals carved into the very planks.

## Demographics
Primarily elite council members, enforcers, cult priests, advisors, and spies. Only the powerful—or the condemned—spend time aboard City Hull.

## Government & Politics
City Hull is the beating heart of Black Brine’s uneasy balance of power. The Captain’s Council meets here, presided over by Gun Deck Rosy. Their decisions shape law, war, and religion. Cult influence is thick, and politics are soaked in blood and whispers.

## Economy
City Hull doesn’t trade coin—it moves fleets, favors, and faith. What happens here echoes across every dock and alley of Black Brine.

## Culture & Daily Life
For most, City Hull is a distant terror. For the few who walk its decks, it’s a crucible of power plays, ritual obedience, and whispered schemes. Every plank groans with old oaths and betrayal.

## Notable NPCs
- **Gun Deck Rosy**: High Priestess of Sedna and Governor of Black Brine. Rules with divine cruelty.
- **Vice-Admiral Brawn**: Rosy’s hammer-fisted enforcer. Loyal, brutal, and dim.
- **Archivist Nyre**: Keeper of the Vault and recorder of council proceedings—said to be a thousand years old.

## Adventure Hooks
- A council member disappears, leaving only a trail of wet footprints.
- A cursed artifact in the Vault begins whispering to those who pass above.
- The war room’s defenses falter during a crucial meeting—someone has sabotaged City Hull from within.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- The keel houses a prison forgotten even by the Council, and something is still alive in it.
- Rosy communes with something below the waves—something older than Sedna.
- The Cathedral Deck can be flooded with brine during rituals to test the faithful.
