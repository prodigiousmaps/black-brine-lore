# Gallows Market

## Overview
Once a place of hangings, now a spectacle of wealth and worship, **Gallows Market** sprawls beneath the towering statue of the Chained God. It’s a riot of sound, color, and conflict—where gilded nobles parade in silks, merchants hawk rare imports, and the unwashed faithful fill the square with murmured prayers. Bright awnings flutter above cobbled paths stained with centuries of blood, now covered in chalk art and flower petals.

## Geography & Layout
- **Central Plaza** – Dominated by the chained statue of the Chained God, its arms wide as if dragging unseen burdens. The statue’s shadow marks time like a sundial.
- **Merchant Stalls** – Jewelry, spices, scrolls, relics, and false blessings—some peddled, some stolen.
- **Temple of the Chained God** – Massive stone edifice rising above the square. Offers aid to the poor, shelter to retired pirates, and sermons dripping with doctrine.
- **Hidden Alcoves & Overlooks** – Used by spies, pickpockets, and secret meetings.

## Role in Black Brine Society
Gallows Market is **where the city’s masks come off and back on again**. Nobles flaunt wealth. Priests preach redemption. The poor beg or steal. Merchants profit. It's a stage for public alliances, secret betrayals, and simmering class tension. The **Temple’s charity** brings the destitute into the district, enraging the elite who once claimed the plaza for themselves.

## Key Features
- **Multicolor Cobblestones** – Each stone painted by children and artists, a fragile act of hope defying the square’s dark past.
- **Public Blessing Pool** – Ringed with coins and flowers, its waters rumored to grant visions.
- **The Hook Wall** – Rusted iron hooks from the square’s execution past, now a grim tourist curiosity.

## Culture & Superstition
- **“Don’t speak the Chained God’s name aloud here”**—it’s said he listens too closely.
- Older residents still place a coin on the ground when passing through at night—for the dead, not the poor.
- It’s good luck to spill wine in the square—bad luck to clean it up.

## Rumors & Adventure Hooks
- A gang of thieves operates openly from beneath the temple.
- The statue moves slightly each season, inching toward the sea.
- One of the priests is a former pirate warlord—now reborn, or merely biding time?
