# Overview
“Where the ships bleed and are reborn.”  
The Dry Docks are the bristling, hammer-struck heart of Black Brine’s maritime might. Hulls are ripped open and stitched anew day and night, surrounded by curses, pitch, and ghosts of ships long sunk.

# Geography & Layout
- **Repair Slips** – Massive cradles for damaged vessels.  
- **Crane Yard** – Pulley towers swinging timbers, cargo, and cannon.  
- **Tarp Halls** – Semi-covered work zones reeking of pitch and salt.  
- **Slip Boss Shanties** – Offices built from wrecks where contracts are signed or cut.  
- **Flood Channels** – Drainage lines sluicing salt water and blood alike.  

# Culture & Economy
- Neutral ground for all captains, though brawls are common.  
- Workers are tough, territorial, and tattooed with crew sigils.  
- Bribes secure faster repairs or hidden modifications.  
- Superstitions guide daily life: no whistling under hulls, chalk warding marks.  

# Notable Figures
- **Old Margit “Rivet Tooth”** – Legendary foreman with a gold-plated hammer and one working eye.  
- **Slip Master Dunro** – Clerk and coin-counter with perfect memory; feared for quiet blackmail.  

# Adventure Hooks
- A warship in Slip #4 is haunted by the ghosts of its drowned crew.  
- Saboteurs damage Council ships under cover of repairs.  
- A cursed figurehead whispers at night beneath a tarp.
