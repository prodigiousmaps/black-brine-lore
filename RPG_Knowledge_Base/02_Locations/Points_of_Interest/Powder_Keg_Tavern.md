# [Powder Keg Tavern]




## Overview
[Built against a sulfur-reeking cliffside, the Powder Keg Tavern is a den of debauchery, violence, and black powder-fueled chaos. Known for its frequent brawls, reckless drinking challenges, and occasional explosions, it attracts gunslingers, mercenaries, and smugglers looking for cheap rum and dangerous company.]




## Geography
[Physical features, layout, climate]




## Notable Features
[
* The main hall is a dimly lit, smoke-filled mess of rough-hewn tables, hanging lanterns, and dented tankards.

* A natural cavern behind the bar serves as a makeshift brewery and gunpowder storage, leading to accidental explosions at least once a month.

* The Cliffside Balcony offers a precarious view of the waves crashing below, popular for duels, drunken dares, and disposing of cheaters.

* Rumors persist of a hidden tunnel beneath the tavern, supposedly leading to an old smuggler’s vault.]

## Notable NPCs
[
Barkeep: Harlow ‘Blastcap’ Grint
   * Dwarven ex-pirate, barrel-chested, always smells of sulfur and rum.

   * Lost most of his left ear in a cannon misfire, but laughed it off and kept drinking.

   * Believes drinks should be served strong enough to knock a grown orc flat.

   * Keeps a "personal stash" of alchemically-infused brews, some of which are technically illegal explosives.

   * If a fight gets too out of hand, he just throws a smoke bomb and lets nature take its course.
Server: Penny "Quickhands" Locke
      * Human woman, dark skin, tattooed arms, fast as lightning.

      * Used to be a ship’s pickpocket, but now lifts coins from drunken pirates instead.

      * Knows how to dodge a bar fight without spilling a drink.

      * Can recite the full list of Black Brine’s banned criminals from memory.

Server: "Slug" the Goblin
         * Tiny, wiry goblin with missing teeth and an infectious cackle.

         * Spent years working the gun decks of various pirate ships before taking up bartending.

         * Makes a cocktail called the "Blunderbuss," which has a 50/50 chance of making you pass out or see gods.

         * Has stabbed at least six customers for getting too handsy.

Server: Big Mags
            * Half-ogre, towering and muscular, wears a butcher’s apron over chainmail.

            * Technically the cook, but also the tavern’s enforcer.

            * Specialty dish: "Galleon’s Bounty"—a stew of questionable ingredients that allegedly has healing properties.

            * Speaks in grunts and threats, but is surprisingly good with a ladle.

Regular: Captain Broome 'The Twice-Hanged'

               * Half-orc, hulking frame, deep rope scars on his neck.

               * Claims he was hanged twice and survived both times, though no one knows how.

               * Drinks a strange, glowing green liquor, won’t say where it’s from.

Regular: Ettie "Firetongue" Jarr

                  * Human alchemist and explosives expert, always singed around the edges.

                  * Sells black powder, blasting sticks, and "experimental" incendiaries out of the Powder Keg’s back room.

                  * Always has a new scar or burn from her latest failed invention.

                  * Once burned down a ship by accident—then stole its treasure while no one was looking.

Regular: Duggan "The Walking Wreck"

                     * Massive goliath mercenary, covered in bruises, broken armor, and half-healed scars.

                     * Gets into a fight almost every night, but somehow never dies.

                     * Is so tough (or stupid) that he once took a cannonball to the chest and just walked it off.

                     * Has a standing bet that no one can knock him out—and he’s won it every time.
