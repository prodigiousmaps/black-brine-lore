# Overview
Built against a sulfur-reeking cliffside, the Powder Keg Tavern is a den of debauchery, violence, and black-powder-fueled chaos. Frequent brawls, reckless drinking challenges, and the occasional explosion draw gunslingers, mercenaries, and smugglers seeking cheap rum and dangerous company.

# Notable Features
- **Main Hall:** Dim, smoke-filled, crammed with rough-hewn tables and dented tankards.  
- **Cavern Brewery:** Natural cavern behind the bar doubles as brewery and powder magazine; accidental blasts occur monthly.  
- **Cliffside Balcony:** Precarious dueling ground and place to throw cheaters to the waves.  
- **Hidden Tunnel (Rumor):** Supposedly leads to an old smuggler’s vault.  

# Notable NPCs
- **Harlow “Blastcap” Grint (Barkeep):** Dwarven ex-pirate; ear lost to cannon misfire; serves brews strong enough to floor an orc; uses smoke bombs to end fights.  
- **Penny “Quickhands” Locke (Server):** Human pickpocket turned server; tattoos, quick reflexes, memorizes Black Brine’s wanted list.  
- **“Slug” (Goblin Server):** Goblin ex-gunner; serves the “Blunderbuss” cocktail—lethal or divine; known for stabbing unruly patrons.  
- **Big Mags (Cook/Enforcer):** Half-ogre in butcher’s apron; makes “Galleon’s Bounty” stew of questionable healing power; both cook and muscle.  

# Regulars
- **Captain Broome “The Twice-Hanged”:** Half-orc with rope scars; claims to have survived two hangings; drinks glowing green liquor; mutters about a cursed coin in Gallows Market.  
- **Ettie “Firetongue” Jarr:** Human alchemist and explosives dealer; perpetually singed; sells blasting sticks and powders; once burned down a ship then stole its treasure.  
- **Duggan “The Walking Wreck”:** Goliath mercenary who survives nightly brawls; once took a cannonball to the chest and walked away; undefeated in knockout bets.  

# Adventure Hooks
- **A Black Powder Deal Gone Wrong:** Someone stole powder from the back room; Blastcap needs it recovered fast.  
- **The Smuggler’s Vault:** A rumored tunnel beneath the tavern leads to treasure, if someone dares to brave it.  
- **An Explosive Disappearance:** Ettie vanishes after a failed experiment; her workshop smolders with clues.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Blastcap hides an alchemical powder recipe potent enough to sink a ship.  
- The hidden tunnel does exist, warded by collapsed powder kegs and unstable traps.
