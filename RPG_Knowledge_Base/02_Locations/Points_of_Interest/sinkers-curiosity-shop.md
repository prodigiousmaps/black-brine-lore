# Overview
A repurposed river sloop beached into the cliffside, its hull now a cramped emporium of cursed trinkets, bottled seas, and whispering relics. The deck creaks under the weight of impossible things; Sinker claims the shop moves when it wants to.

# Notable Features
- Cabinet of “once-blessed, twice-cursed” relics.
- Nets hung with bones, shells, and charms against drowning.
- Locked sea-chest Sinker refuses to sell—ever.

# Adventure Hooks
- A “harmless” charm sold here begins haunting its buyer.
- A rival fence wants a particular bottle back—before it opens.
- A ledger reveals buyers tied to Sedna’s shrines.

# Secrets (DM Only)
- The sloop’s bilge hides a sealed idol that warps tides nearby.
- Sinker can hear items “speak” the last words of their owners.
