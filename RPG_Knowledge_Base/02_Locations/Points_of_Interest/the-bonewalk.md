# Overview
A narrow pier stitched from shipwreck timbers and whale bone. It groans like a dying hull when storms near, and lanterns along its spine gutter without wind.

# Notable Features
- Bone-pins and rib-arches carved with sailor prayers.
- Hidden mooring rings used by smugglers at low tide.
- Tide-pools that occasionally whisper back.

# Adventure Hooks
- At moonrise the Bonewalk keens; something comes in with the fog.
- A smuggler cache is wedged in a whale skull far below the tide line.
- A child goes missing; footprints end atop the pier’s last rib.

# Secrets (DM Only)
- The final pylon is driven through a drowned altar; it’s waking.
- Bone-carvings are a crude ward—removing them invites the sea in.
