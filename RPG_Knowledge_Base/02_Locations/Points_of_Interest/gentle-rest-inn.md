# Overview
A raucous tavern where laughter turns to screams below the floorboards. Contracts are sealed in blood; debts are collected in the cellar. The Butchers call it “neutral ground,” but only fools believe that.

# Notable Features
- Private back rooms with sound-dampening planks.
- Cellar with hooks, drains, and prayer-scarred posts.
- Balcony booths where The Noose watches undisturbed.

# Adventure Hooks
- A debtor begs the PCs to extract them before “last call.”
- A blood-inked contract must be stolen and burned to break it.
- A hidden witness saw a Council envoy meet The Noose here.

# Secrets (DM Only)
- A tunnel under the cellar links to reef caves used by the cult.
- The floorboards are inlaid with runes that bind oaths.
