# Red Door Alchemy

## Overview
Tucked in a vine-choked alley off the salt-worn warrens of Salt Crown Shores, Red Door Alchemy is a low-slung, windowless shop marked only by a crimson-painted door and the scent of exotic herbs. It deals in potions, tinctures, and alchemical oddities—legal, questionable, and otherwise.

## Geography
Built partly into the bluff wall with deep storage cellars beneath, the shop is insulated from the heat and damp. A crooked chimney leaks foul-smelling smoke day and night.

## Notable Features
- Crimson door reinforced with runes of warding
- Glass-fronted potion cases with magically chilled shelves
- Smoldering incense at all times (supposedly suppresses explosive reactions)
- Talking crow named *Marrow* that guards the register

## Proprietor
- **Maelia Gorse**, a pale, sharp-eyed half-elf with ink-stained fingers and an encyclopedic knowledge of venoms and cures
- Her apprentice, *Brin*, is mute but disturbingly fast with a bone saw

## Economy
Rare ingredients fetch high prices, and most customers pay in coin, favors, or items of equal weirdness. Fleet captains often send runners with coded orders.

## Culture & Daily Life
Locals know better than to linger too long. Some come for love potions, others for poisons. Maelia treats them all the same—coldly and efficiently. She refuses to sell to anyone she deems “emotionally compromised.”

## Secrets & Hidden Information
The Red Door leads to a deeper subchamber not on the building’s original plans—used for experiments Maelia won't discuss. Rumor says she once worked for Sedna’s cult, brewing elixirs from drowned flesh.

## Adventure Hooks
- A customer overdosed on a love tonic and now believes a sea hag is their soulmate
- A stolen potion is causing wild magical side effects
- Someone wants Maelia assassinated—but her shop is warded beyond belief

## Connected Locations
- Sinker's Curiosities (frequent ingredient trade)
- Gentle Rest Inn (sells her sedatives and painkillers under the table)
- The Powder Keg Tavern (supplies aphrodisiacs and 'performance enhancers')
