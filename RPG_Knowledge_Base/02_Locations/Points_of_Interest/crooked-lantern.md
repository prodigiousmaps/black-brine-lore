# Overview
A half-sunken tavern propped on stilts above a stagnant canal. The Crooked Lantern is a haven for drunks, smugglers, and those seeking secrets whispered over cheap grog. Its warped beams and swaying lantern give it its name.  

# Notable Features

- Patrons vanish without explanation, feeding superstition.  
- Staff often found dazed, as if waking from dreams.  

# Adventure Hooks
- A barkeep begs for help after a string of vanishings.  
- A dream-plagued NPC recounts visions of Sednaâ€™s shrines.  
- A mysterious patron offers the PCs cursed ale.  

# Secrets (DM Only)

- Disappearances are tied to Foghouse Row tunnels.
