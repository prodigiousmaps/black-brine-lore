# Rita's Smithy

## Overview
More than just a forge, Rita’s Smithy is now a renowned compound for the crafting and teaching of masterwork weapons, armor, and tools. Situated in Salt Crown, this compound has grown into a crucible of heat, skill, and discipline. Under the guidance of Rita Kess—Black Brine’s finest weaponsmith—it produces steel strong enough to win wars and minds sharp enough to make it.

## Geography & Layout
- A **multi-building compound** of dark stone and volcanic brick, built into a sloping rise in Salt Crown.
- **Main forge**: domed, open-sided structure that glows day and night.
- **Housing wing**: modest but clean quarters for four live-in journeymen smiths.
- **Learning Hall**: contains blueprints, examples of past masterworks, and blackboard lessons from Rita.
- **Shrine Chamber**: a reverent, quiet room dedicated to **Gond**, god of craft and invention.

## Notable Features

### The Forge of Echoes
- An ancient dwarven anvil is set at the center of the main forge, rumored to **“remember” techniques** and vibrate with resonance when new techniques are attempted.

### Shrine to Gond
- A circular alcove adorned with intricate clockwork sculptures, blueprints, and gears.
- Pilgrims sometimes visit for a blessing before beginning major works.
- Maintained with meticulous care by Rita herself—her only true religion.

## Culture & Operations
- Operates like a guild hall: apprentices work, journeymen live and train, Rita oversees all.
- Focus on **discipline, function, and elegance**—no ornamental fluff unless it serves a purpose.
- Every member must **forge their own tools** as a rite of entry.
- Journeymen rotate duties in **market sales, commission negotiations, and city defense contracts**.

## Lore & Rumors
- Some whisper the forge’s fire is elemental in origin, gifted by a salamander Rita once saved.
- A shattered hammer above the entrance is all that remains from a rival who challenged Rita to a smith-off. She lets it hang as a reminder: "Shape metal, not ego."

## Adventure Hooks

- A noble demands Rita forge him an unbreakable sword—and threatens to burn the place down when she refuses.
