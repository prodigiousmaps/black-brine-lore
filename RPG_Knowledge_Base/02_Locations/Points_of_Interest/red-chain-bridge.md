# Overview
A massive iron-and-chain bridge spanning the Black Brine River, infamous for eerie legends and ghost stories. Sailors avoid it on foggy nights, fearing the presence of the Nameless Watcher.

# Legends: The Nameless Watcher
A silent, hooded figure seen motionless on the bridge, most often in storms or heavy fog. Details consistent across all sightings:
- The Watcher never moves, speaks, or reacts.
- It always faces west, toward the Daggerflow.
- Approaching it brings paralyzing dread.
- Sailors claim seeing the Watcher before a voyage guarantees doom.

# Theories
- **Captain Edran Stohl’s Ghost** – Said to be the spirit of the executed Black Leviathan, waiting eternally for his fleet. Witnesses describe hollow eyes and drowned flesh.
- **Servant of Sedna** – Sedna’s priests call it a harbinger of storms. Those who pray report hearing whispers from the water, never remembered after.
- **Guardian of the Chains** – Some believe it is bound to the bridge itself, keeping darker forces below from escaping.

# Strange Sightings
- Seen briefly in daylight; the stones where it stood left wet as if something rose from the river.  
- A smuggler collapsed after touching it, drained of blood by morning.  
- A traveler claimed it turned to face him; he vanished the next day.  

# Adventure Hooks
- **Message from the Watcher** – A crew member wakes marked with a chain-shaped brand, echoing the bridge.  
- **The Watcher Moves** – Witnessed leaving the bridge for the first time; something in Black Brine changes overnight.  
- **A Forgotten Ritual** – Ancient texts suggest the Watcher was once human, bound by blood sacrifice. Can it be freed—or should it remain?
