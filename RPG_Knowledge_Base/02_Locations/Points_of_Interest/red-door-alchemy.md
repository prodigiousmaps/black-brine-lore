# Overview
A windowless, crimson-doored apothecary in the warrens, steeped in exotic scents. Potions, poisons, and oddities—sold for coin, favors, or equal weirdness.

# Geography
Built into the bluff with cool cellars; a crooked chimney leaks foul smoke night and day.

# Notable Features
- Runes ward the crimson door
- Chilled potion cases behind glass
- Constant incense to “stabilize” reactions
- Talking crow **Marrow** at the till

# Proprietor
**Maelia Gorse**, pale, ink-stained, encyclopedic on venoms/cures. Apprentice **Brin** is mute—and fast with a bone saw.

# Culture & Policy
No sales to the “emotionally compromised.” Fleet captains send coded orders.

# Secrets (DM Only)
A sealed sub-chamber hosts experiments; rumors tie Maelia to Sedna’s cult.

# Adventure Hooks
- Love-tonic overdose fixates a patron on a sea hag
- Stolen potion causes wild surges
- Contract on Maelia—shop wards complicate the hit
