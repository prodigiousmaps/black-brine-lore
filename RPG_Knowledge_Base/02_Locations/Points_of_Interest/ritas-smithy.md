# Overview
A renowned forge-compound for crafting and teaching masterwork arms and tools under Rita Kess—Black Brine’s finest weaponsmith.

# Geography & Layout
Multi-building compound of dark stone and volcanic brick on a rising slope:
- **Main Forge** (domed, open-sided, perpetual glow)
- **Housing Wing** (journeymen quarters)
- **Learning Hall** (blueprints & masterworks)
- **Shrine Chamber** to **Gond**, god of craft

# Notable Features
- **Forge of Echoes**: ancient dwarven anvil that “remembers” techniques
- Shrine alcove of clockwork sculpture and gears

# Culture & Operations
Guild-like discipline; apprentices forge their own tools; journeymen rotate market, commission, and defense-contract duties.

# Lore & Rumors
Elemental fire gifted by a salamander; a rival’s shattered hammer hangs as a warning: “Shape metal, not ego.”

# Adventure Hooks
- Journeyman missing after forging a humming blade
- Shrine gears move on their own, blueprints rewrite
- A noble demands an “unbreakable” sword—threats follow refusal
