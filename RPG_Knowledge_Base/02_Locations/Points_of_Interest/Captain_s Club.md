# Captain's Club

### **The Captain’s Club – Black Brine’s Most Exclusive Tavern**

- A **private and exclusive tavern**, built inside the **hull of an old warship**, reserved **only for ship captains (current and former)**.

- Located **off the main docks**, it serves as **a meeting place for Black Brine’s elite pirates, mercenary leaders, and smugglers**.

- The atmosphere is **dimly lit and thick with pipe smoke**, with **fine but stolen furnishings, barrels of rare rum, and high-stakes gambling tables**.

- **Tavern staff are sworn to secrecy**, and **betraying the confidence of another captain within these walls is considered a death sentence**.

- The **back rooms** are often used for **private negotiations, alliances, and covert deals**.

- While it is a place of prestige, it is **not without conflict**, and more than a few captains have been **dragged out dead after a dispute over debts, betrayals, or honor**.

- Runs **the strongest drinks in Black Brine**, including a house specialty: **"The Widowmaker"**, a rum so potent it **has a warning etched into the bottle**.
