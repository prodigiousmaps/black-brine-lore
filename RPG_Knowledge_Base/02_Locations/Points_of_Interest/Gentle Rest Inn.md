# Gentle Rest Inn

## Overview
Once a reputable traveler’s haven, the Gentle Rest Inn now serves as the base of operations for **The Butchers**, a brutal gang led by the infamous crime boss known as **The Noose**. Though still open to the public, its innkeeping is a front. Those who enter for a room may find themselves watched—or worse.

## Appearance
A crooked, multi-story building of damp stone and aging timber, its facade leans slightly under the salt-heavy wind. Crimson lanterns hang from wrought iron hooks, casting a deceptive warmth. Inside, it smells of sweat, mildew, and old blood hidden beneath spiced rum and pipe smoke.

## Layout
- **First Floor**: Main bar, dining area, and two rentable rooms. Always busy. Gang members linger here under the guise of patrons.
- **Second Floor**: Guest rooms (often bugged, trapped, or repurposed for "interrogations").
- **Third Floor**: Private quarters and operations room for The Noose and senior Butchers. Hidden passages connect to watch points and secret exits.
- **Cellar**: Contains supplies, hidden smuggling compartments, and a torture chamber disguised as a wine room.

## Notable Features
- **Creaking Chandelier**: Said to sway even when the air is still—used as a signal by gang members.
- **Bloodstained Floorboard**: Covered by a rug, never quite cleaned.
- **Secret Rooftop Access**: Provides a route for rooftop escape or infiltration.

## Culture & Operations
- Locals avoid it unless they have business with The Butchers—or no other options.
- Rivals vanish after booking rooms.
- The inn is a hub for smuggling coordination, extortion meetings, and information gathering.
- Gang enforcers patrol the building under the guise of bouncers and serving staff.

## Lore & Rumors
- The inn was named by a dying sailor who wanted to "rest easy." The irony is not lost on the locals.
- Some say the third floor is haunted—not by ghosts, but by what’s still alive and hidden in the walls.

## Connected Characters
- **The Noose** – gang leader and master of secrets and torture
- **The Butchers** – gang members known for their cleavers and red leather armor
- **Rival Gangs** – keep tabs on the inn, planning revenge or infiltration

## Adventure Hooks
- A local girl was last seen entering the Gentle Rest. Her family offers a bounty.
- The party is hired to steal a key from The Noose's office. Problem: He never leaves it.
- A masked guest is secretly a spy from a rival fleet, and he’s just been discovered.
