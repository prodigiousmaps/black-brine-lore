# String & Power

## Overview
Once a cozy cottage on a grassy bluff, **String & Power** is now one of the most well-known and volatile weapon shops in Black Brine. Split down the middle—half bowyer, half gunsmith—it’s the lifelong project of the Gunderson brothers, Reevey and Darnell, whose bickering is only matched by their brilliance. Their shared home has become the go-to location for custom bows, rifles, and professional-grade projectiles of all kinds.

## Appearance
The old home leans into its charm: red-tinted ivy climbs stone chimneys, and hydrangea bushes bloom beneath hand-wrought windows. But the cozy impression shatters the moment you see the porch—littered with shattered arrow shafts, broken barrels, and a lopsided target dummy wearing a dented breastplate. Smoke wafts from both chimneys, one scented like pine pitch, the other gun oil and burnt powder.

## Layout
- **North Wing ("String")** – Warm, wood-paneled workshop filled with exotic woods, yew staves, and rune-etched arrows. Walls lined with longbows and crossbows of masterwork quality.
- **South Wing ("Power")** – Steel-plated room ringing with hammer strikes and the smell of burnt cordite. Firearms, flintlocks, and experimental contraptions in every corner.
- **Central Hall** – A long stone corridor filled with mismatched chairs, an oversized fireplace, and family heirlooms. This space functions as shared showroom, neutral zone, and argument stage.
- **Upstairs** – Private quarters for the brothers. A separate attic is locked, rumored to hold a shared prototype they both refuse to finish.

## Proprietors
- **Reevey Gunderson** ("String") – Reserved, deliberate, and loyal to traditional craftsmanship. Always smells of pine, always wears soft leather gloves.
- **Darnell Gunderson** ("Power") – Loud, brash, and convinced gunpowder is the future. Often has soot on his face and keeps a loaded pistol tucked in his apron.

## Shop Culture
- Customers are never allowed to praise one brother’s craft over the other.
- "Custom commissions" may take weeks if the brothers are feuding.
- Apprentices must learn both crafts before choosing a path.

## Goods & Services
- Masterwork bows, crossbows, arrows (String)
- Pistols, muskets, custom powder weapons (Power)
- Hybrid devices for elite clients
- Repairs, ammunition, and tuning

## Rumors & Hooks
- A prototype weapon hidden in the attic could change naval warfare.
- Darnell may be secretly supplying The Noose.
- Reevey’s arrows are whispered to be “true-seeking” if paid in blood.

## Reputation
Feuding geniuses. If they ever worked together on purpose, the results would terrify the gods.
