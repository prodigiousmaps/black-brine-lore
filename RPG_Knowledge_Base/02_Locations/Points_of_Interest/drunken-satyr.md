# Overview
A crooked two-story tavern of driftwood and sea-scavenged beams. Music from nowhere, rooms that never look the same twice, and a barkeep who never sleeps.

# Geography
Stilted into a cliff hollow; rope-anchored against tides; lantern-lit path down from the market.

# Notable Features
- Layout & décor subtly shift between visits
- Stage for bards and storytellers
- Strange upper rooms—some locked for decades
- Cellar rumored to open into something older

# Demographics
Fishers, poets, hedge-wizards, nobles “slumming.”

# Culture & Daily Life
Barter, coin, or riddles accepted. Brawls end within a minute—something unseen intervenes.

# Secrets (DM Only)
Built atop a druidic circle—or the tavern’s founder was a cursed fey. Lights in upper windows after midnight.

# Adventure Hooks
- A map left behind can’t be unfolded indoors.
- A bard vanishes mid-song; his voice lingers.
- Eclipse-brew grants troubling visions.
