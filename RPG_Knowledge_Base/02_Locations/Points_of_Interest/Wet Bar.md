# The Wet Bar

## Overview
A refined watering hole built for those who live half their lives below the waves, **The Wet Bar** is the city’s only fully aquatic-access tavern. Built into the riverbank at the southern edge of Crosswater, it caters to the sea-bound elite and curious land-dwellers eager to rub elbows with them—sometimes literally.

## Appearance
From the bluff, the Wet Bar appears like a low-slung villa of marble and lacquered wood with stained-glass portholes. Below, its first floor is entirely submerged, with glowing runes illuminating its waterlogged interior. River light filters through enchanted glass, casting ripples across silk-draped booths and coral chandeliers. The second floor, half-dry and half-damp, features aquatic gardens, soft seating, and open river balconies.

## Layout
- **Level 1 – Submerged Lounge**: Accessible via canal slips and diving stairs; includes bubble-sealed bar and aquatic performance tank.
- **Level 2 – Partial Submersion**: Dry bar, dining area, balconies for air-breathers; water-channel tables where guests can converse across the divide.
- **Private Pods**: Magically insulated conversation booths beneath the water’s surface—perfect for clandestine deals.

## Notable Features
- **Kelpsmoke Hookahs** and **Pearl Wine Flights** served by both air- and water-breathing staff.
- Live performances from siren singers and deep-lute players.
- **Bioluminescent mood orbs** adjust ambient lighting to guest preferences.

## Culture & Norms
- Conversations here are soft, measured, and often dangerously polite.
- The bar maintains neutrality in political and fleet matters—violence is not tolerated.
- Patrons are expected to **pay in coin or curiosity**—some bar tabs are settled with information.

## Regulars & Staff
- **Brivis** – sea elf proprietor with a knack for subtle manipulation and perfect recall.
- **Dockshella** – triton bartender who remembers every drink you’ve ever had.
- **The Misted One** – cloaked figure in a bubble mask who trades secrets for silence.

## Rumors & Hooks
- A pirate fleet captain was last seen entering a private pod—he never emerged.
- Whispers say the deepest tank isn’t just decorative—it leads somewhere.
- A stolen item vital to Sedna’s cult is hidden in one of the guest pods.

## Connected Factions
- **Sea-born patrons** from the coastal trenches, Chultan reef tribes, and deepwater enclaves.
- **Merchant spies** and **fleet emissaries** use the space for quiet diplomacy.
