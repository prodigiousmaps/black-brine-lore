# Overview
A cliff-hidden tower woven with demiplane seams, Rupert’s Rest is part fortress, part laboratory. It is both a refuge and prison for Rupert’s circle, wrapped in wards that shimmer at twilight.

# Features
- **Shifting Geometry:** Rooms realign themselves daily.  
- **Runed Gates:** Entrances open only to those with Rupert’s sigils.  
- **Sea Observatory:** A chamber for watching storms and Sedna’s tides.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- An unstable rift to another plane hums beneath the study.  
- The tower’s foundation is partly submerged in brine linked to Sedna’s chains.
