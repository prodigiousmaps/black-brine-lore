# Rupert's Rest

## Overview
Rupert’s Rest is a towering arcane structure of ivory stone and impossible geometry that appeared overnight west of Black Brine, beyond the river and deep in Sedna’s forbidden domain. Its spiraling spires shimmer with latent magic, and the air around it buzzes like a struck tuning fork. It is the home of the exiled archmage Rupert, who arrived under mysterious circumstances after escaping a political disaster on the mainland.

## Geography
Perched on a rise in the jungle overlooking the river, the tower is isolated and surrounded by thick foliage and unnatural stillness. The terrain seems subtly warped, with no birdsong or animal life nearby. A stone path, unnaturally clean, leads to its obsidian door.

## Notable Features
- The entire tower exists partially in a personal demi-plane
- Windows show different skies—some stormy, some starless
- Door only opens when touched with a specific magical sigil
- Magical energy field repels Sedna’s faithful and disrupts divination

## Demographics
Rupert lives alone, though rumors speak of homunculi, magical echoes of himself, and planar creatures that answer only to him.

## Government & Politics
Rupert claims no allegiance to Rosy or the Captains’ Council, though he struck an uneasy truce with the city. He is tolerated due to his power and utility but feared and watched closely.

## Economy
Does not trade often, but occasionally purchases rare ingredients, inks, and arcane curios. Pays in platinum or favors. Hires quietly when necessary, and pays extremely well.

## Culture & Daily Life
Rupert is reclusive and mercurial. He spends most days researching forbidden lore, crafting magical items, or communicating with entities beyond the veil. He is rarely seen outside his tower except to gather obscure texts or strange components from the city.

## Notable NPCs
- **Rupert the White** – Former archmage of the mainland, reborn in a younger cloned body after his death in a magical conflict. Eccentric, brilliant, paranoid.

## Adventure Hooks
- Rupert hires the party to retrieve a forbidden tome held in the Deep Locker of the Black Brine Library.
- A magical surge from the tower causes a rift to appear in Salt Crown.
- Sedna’s cult marks Rupert for assassination, and he needs protection—without admitting it.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- Rupert’s tower feeds on ley lines buried beneath Sedna’s temple ruins.
- He is researching ways to manipulate divine anchors—perhaps even usurp a god.
- His clone body is deteriorating faster than expected; he is running out of time.
