# Overview
An ancient stone well at the heart of Blackmire, filled with offerings to a swamp spirit known as the Whisperer. Locals toss coins, charms, and blood into its depths, praying for secrets or protection.  

# Notable Features
- Moss-draped stones and fetid water.  
- Offerings cling to the edges: charms, teeth, and bone tokens.  
- Voices echo faintly when the fog is thickest.  

# Adventure Hooks
- The PCs overhear their own secrets whispered back from the well.  
- A cult of the Whisperer demands a blood tithe.  
- A noble seeks a relic from the bottom of the well.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- The Whisperer is a fragment of Sedna’s chained power.  
- At new moon, the well becomes a portal to the Shrouded Grotto.
