# The Drunken Satyr

## Overview
The Drunken Satyr is a crooked two-story tavern built from warped driftwood and sea-scavenged beams, leaning into the bluffside warrens of Salt Crown Shores. Its slanted sign bears the image of a leering satyr raising a mug. Strange music plays from unseen sources, and no two visits are ever the same.

## Geography
Nestled in a hollow carved from cliffside stone, the tavern stands on stilts over slick rock and moss. Ropes anchor it against strong tides and storm-winds. A narrow stone path from the market winds down past flickering lanterns and salt-stained statuary.

## Notable Features
- Interior decor shifts subtly between visits: chairs move, portraits change
- First floor houses the bar, fire pit, and crude stage for bards and storytellers
- Second floor contains strange guest rooms—no two alike, and some locked for decades
- A cellar rumored to contain an entrance to an older structure beneath

## Demographics
Frequented by fishers, drunk poets, hedge-wizards, and disillusioned nobles slumming it. The regulars are odd, the barkeep is older than he looks, and nobody ever sees him sleep.

## Culture & Daily Life
The Satyr operates on barter, coin, or riddles. Patrons sometimes wake with trinkets in their pockets—or strange dreams. No brawls last longer than a minute; something unseen intervenes.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
Some believe the tavern was built atop an old druidic circle and is still under its enchantment. Others claim the original owner was a fey creature cursed to serve drinks until forgotten. Odd lights glow in the upper windows after midnight.

## Adventure Hooks
- A traveler left behind a map that can’t be unfolded indoors
- A bard vanished mid-song—no one remembers his name, but his voice lingers
- A rare drink brewed only on lunar eclipses reveals visions to those who imbibe
