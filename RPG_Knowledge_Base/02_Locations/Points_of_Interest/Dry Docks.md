# Dry Docks of Crosswater

## Overview
"Where the ships bleed and are reborn."  
The Dry Docks are the bristling, groaning, hammer-struck heart of Black Brine’s maritime might. Wood splits, steel shrieks, and curses echo day and night as hulls are ripped open and stitched anew. It’s a place of labor, legend, and lingering ghosts of ships long sunk.

## Geography & Layout
- **Repair Slips** – Several massive cradles for lifting and bracing damaged vessels.
- **Crane Yard** – Rattling pulley towers that swing timbers, cargo, and cannon across wide platforms.
- **Tarp Halls** – Semi-covered work zones reeking of pitch, salt, and wet rope.
- **Slip Boss Shanties** – Crude offices built from shipwrecks where contracts are signed, shouted, or knifed into flesh.
- **Flood Channels** – Drainage lines that sluice salt water and blood alike.

## Purpose in Society
The Dry Docks are where fleets are forged and fortunes repaired. Essential to Black Brine’s economy and power structure, they **serve all captains**, from gutter-privateers to Council lords. When a fleet returns broken from battle, it limps here. If you want a hull re-enchanted, a keel mended, or a cannon quietly mounted—you come to Crosswater.

## Culture & Economy
- Workers are tough, territorial, and often tattooed with their crew's sigil.
- The docks are **neutral ground**, but brawls still break out—settled with fists, not steel.
- Bribes are common to jump repair queues or smuggle cargo into the hull.
- Superstition runs deep: workers won’t whistle under a hull or step over certain chalk markings.

## Notable Figures
- **Old Margit "Rivet Tooth"** – Legendary foreman with a gold-plated hammer and one working eye.
- **Slip Master Dunro** – Clerk and coin-counter, feared more than most captains for his uncanny memory and quiet blackmail.

## Rumors & Adventure Hooks
- A warship refitted in Slip #4 is haunted by the last crew it lost at sea.
- A saboteur has been damaging Council ships under the cover of dock work.
- A cursed figurehead hidden beneath a tarp is said to whisper in the night.
