overview: >
  The Soggy Town Playhouse is a half-sunken old frigate dragged ashore and reborn as Black Brine’s most raucous and beloved stage. Its boards creak with drama, comedy, and scandal in equal measure.

appearance: >
  The ship’s hull leans slightly, propped by scaffolding and optimism. Plankwalks lead into candlelit corridors strung with costumes, driftwood masks, and faded playbills. The stage is where the gun deck once was—still bearing scorched boards from its former life.

role_in_society: >
  Part community refuge, part cultural lighthouse, the Playhouse draws sailors, street urchins, and elites alike. It offers distraction, inspiration, and sometimes covert messages wrapped in satire. Performances often toe the line of political mockery.

services:
  - Nightly shows of original and adapted works
  - Bardic performances, puppet shows, and shadow plays
  - Cheap drinks and seaweed-wrapped popcorn
  - Occasional after-hours masked galas

notable_features:
  - “The Cannon Stage” – features a retractable trapdoor and smoke-pipe special effects
  - “Captain’s Balcony” – VIP seating with enchanted acoustics
  - “The Hold” – dressing rooms, prop storage, and impromptu sleeping quarters

associated_npcs:
  - Calwyn “Claps” Dorrin (dramatic director with a flair for scandal)
  - Berta Gullswain (retired pirate turned costume mistress)
  - Mop (stagehand goblin who also plays 6 minor roles per show)

rumors:
  - The Playhouse is secretly funded by the Council of Free Captains
  - Actors have disappeared mid-play with no explanation
  - A ghostly sailor sometimes appears during tragedies, weeping in the rafters

secrets:
  - The keel of the ship hides a sealed smuggling tunnel now used to store dangerous props and occasionally people
  - Calwyn was once an informant for the House of Questions—he might still be
