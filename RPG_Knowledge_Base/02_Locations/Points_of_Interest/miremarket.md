# Overview
A chaotic sprawl of tents and leaning stalls, disguised as a salvage bazaar but truly the beating heart of Blackmire’s black market. Anything forbidden, stolen, or cursed can be found here — for a price.  

# Notable Features
- Shack-stalls selling swamp herbs, relics, and contraband.  
- Faded banners claiming legitimacy as a “trade fair.”  
- Gangs patrol in shifts, taking cuts from every sale.  

# Adventure Hooks
- A relic trader offers a map fragment to Sedna’s shrines.  
- The Butchers crack down on competition, sparking a turf war.  
- A buyer wants an item smuggled through Miremarket — no questions asked.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- A hidden tunnel beneath the Miremarket connects to Foghouse Row.  
- The Butchers fund much of their influence here.
