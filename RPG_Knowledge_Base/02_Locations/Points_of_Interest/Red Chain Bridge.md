# Red Chain Bridge

### **The Nameless Watcher – The Phantom of the Red Chain Bridge**

A **silent, hooded figure** is sometimes **seen standing motionless** on the Red Chain Bridge, usually on **fog-drenched nights or during storms**. No one knows **who or what it is**, but everyone agrees on a few chilling details:

- The Watcher **never moves, never speaks**, and never reacts to anyone who passes.

- It always stands **facing the west side of Black Brine**, as if **watching for something beyond the Daggerflow**.

- Those who **attempt to approach it** report feeling **a deep, paralyzing dread**, as if **they are being watched by something far worse**.

- Some sailors claim that **if you see the Watcher, you should never set sail the next morning**—or **you will not return**.

### **Theories & Legends About the Watcher**

1. **Captain Edran Stohl’s Restless Ghost**

    - Some believe the **Watcher is none other than The Black Leviathan**, the pirate lord who **vanished after his execution** on the bridge.

    - It is said he **watches the west because he is waiting for his fleet to return**, but **they never will**.

    - Those who have seen **his face beneath the hood** describe **hollow black eyes and skin like drowned flesh**.

2. **A Servant of Sedna**

    - Priests of Sedna claim the Watcher is **a harbinger**, warning of **a great storm or disaster** before it happens.

    - The few who have **dared to speak to it in prayer** have reported hearing **a whisper from the water**—though **none remember what was said**.

3. **The Guardian of the Chains**

    - A darker theory claims the **Watcher is bound to the chains beneath the bridge**, acting as a **guardian of something far worse**.

    - Some say that if the Watcher **ever leaves the bridge**, the chains will **break, and whatever they are holding back will be freed**.

### **Strange Sightings & Unsettling Encounters**

- **One pirate swore he saw the Watcher standing on the bridge during the day. When he looked back, it was gone—but the ground where it stood was wet, as if something had risen from the river.**

- **A drunken smuggler once tried to touch the Watcher. He screamed, collapsed, and was found dead the next morning—his body shriveled, as if drained of blood.**

- **A lost traveler claimed the Watcher turned to face him. The next day, he disappeared without a trace.**

### **Mystery Hooks & Potential Encounters**

- **The Watcher Moves** – One night, the Watcher is **seen stepping off the bridge for the first time**. The next morning, **something has changed in Black Brine**—but what?

- **A Forgotten Ritual** – Old texts suggest that **the Watcher was once human** and bound to the bridge through an ancient **blood sacrifice**. Can they be freed—or should they remain trapped?
