overview: >
  The Golden Gull is an upscale tavern nestled between warehouses and sea-captain estates in the Crosswater District. Known for its fine drink, softer lighting, and whispered dealings, it serves merchants, smugglers, and off-duty fleet officers looking for luxury without judgment.

appearance: >
  Lanterns hang from curved brass arms, casting golden pools of light across polished wood and sea-glass windows. A mounted gull in mid-flight—wings spread and dipped in gold leaf—hangs from the ceiling. Sea breezes curl through tall shuttered windows.

role_in_society: >
  The Golden Gull is where Crosswater's deals are struck over clinking glasses and songs carry rumors farther than sails. It's a favored neutral ground for mid-tier captains, council informants, and discreet power brokers. Spies, singers, and smooth-tongued fixers make it their haunt.
