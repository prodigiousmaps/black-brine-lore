overview: >
  The Lending House of Black Brine is the beating heart of the city’s wealth, where fortunes are made, ruined, and whispered into shadow. Towering and ivy-draped, its fortress-like stone walls house vaults deeper than most cellars dare to dig, and its interest rates are whispered with more fear than most curses.

appearance: >
  The building looms over Salt Crown like a silent warden of gold. Its architecture is high-walled and austere—gilded ironwork over glass, rust-red ivy crawling up polished limestone, and gargoyle spouts shaped like open purses. Its rooftop garden, the Velvet Nest, teems with lush blooms and velvet canopies for secretive soirees.

  The Lending House serves as the city’s unofficial treasury, mint, and stockade of secrets. It issues coin, holds captain’s war chests, and facilitates high-stakes loans with arcane enforcement clauses. It is both an engine of the city's economy and a spider’s web of obligation, tightly wrapped around captains, nobles, and merchants alike.
