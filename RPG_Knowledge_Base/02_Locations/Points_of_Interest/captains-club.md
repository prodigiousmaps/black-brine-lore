# Overview
An invitation-only tavern built into the hull of an old warship, just off the main docks. It serves Black Brine’s elite—current and former ship captains, mercenary leaders, and smugglers. The rooms are dim, smoke-thick, and furnished with stolen finery; deals are struck in murmurs while Dragonchess and high-stakes cards clatter under lantern light.

# House Rules
- Staff are sworn to secrecy; betraying a captain’s confidence is a death sentence.  
- Disputes are settled **outside**, never inside.  
- Back rooms are for private negotiations, alliances, and covert deals.

# Staff
- **“Iron” Ida Gallows (Barkeep):** Former quartermaster; missing two fingers from a bet with Gun Deck Rosy. Keeps a loaded pistol beneath the bar and serves the club’s signature rum, **The Widowmaker**.  
- **Marla “Red” Rennett (Server):** Human, ex-bosun ousted in a mutiny; saves for a new ship and trades gossip for coin—poison, if needed.  
- **Flicker (Server):** Halfling with quick hands and quicker exit sense; ex-cook stranded after a sea-monster attack; sells whispers to the highest bidder.

# Regulars
- **Captain Elias Vex:** Retired legend; drinks dark spiced rum, wagers Dragonchess; lost *The Hollow Maiden* in a storm—location unknown.  
- **Zali the Drunk:** Tabaxi privateer; wooden tail; downs The Widowmaker without blinking; claims he’s been dead for years.  
- **Old Ruth:** Tiefling with rune-carved horns; once ran ghost-ship illusions; vanished five years and won’t say where; smokes a pipe of spirit-sight.

# Adventure Hooks
- A captain is murdered **outside** the club—everyone inside swears they saw nothing.  
- A back-room meeting pulls the PCs into a three-way double-cross.  
- Iron Ida’s missing-finger bet comes due—tonight.

# Secrets (DM Only)
- The hull hides a contraband vault with ledgers that could topple two captains.  
- “The Widowmaker” recipe includes a rare Sednan brine; prolonged use breeds visions.
