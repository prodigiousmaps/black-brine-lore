# Old Salt Eatery

## Overview
A battered, half-sunken tavern perched on stilts above the Blackmire muck, the Old Salt Eatery is the district’s most reliable source of food, gossip, and cheap grog. It smells like burnt fish, spilled brine, and old secrets. Locals swear the soup tastes different every day—mostly because it does.

## Geography
Located near the center of Blackmire, where the sludge channels narrow, the eatery hangs partially over a slow-moving canal. Lanterns strung on ropes sway in the fog, and planks creak with every footfall.

## Notable Features
- Signature dish: “Saltfather’s Stew” (ingredients unknown)
- Fish tank bar table filled with eels
- Daily “Catch & Gamble” game where patrons bet on swamp creatures
- Salt-crusted floorboards said to be blessed by Sedna (or cursed by the cook)

## Demographics
Mostly Blackmire locals, laborers, smugglers, out-of-luck pirates, and the occasional Inquisitor.

## Government & Politics
Neutral ground—no blades drawn, no questions asked. Run by old sea dog **Garrik “Salttooth” Vane**, a retired cook with a hook for a hand and a tongue sharp as a filet knife.

## Economy
Cheap meals, local brews, underground betting. Sometimes used for dead drops or hushed meetings in curtained corners.

## Culture & Daily Life
Rowdy, reeking of brine and spice. Tables carved with old names and forgotten crews. Every night carries a different flavor of danger, but the regulars wouldn’t eat anywhere else.

## Notable NPCs
- **Salttooth Vane** – Gruff, one-eyed owner. Claims to have cooked for three pirate kings.
- **Krixie** – Halfling server with sticky fingers and a sharp memory.
- **Branwell** – Off-duty dockhand who’s always there, always watching.

## Adventure Hooks
- A regular customer was poisoned—accident, or message?
- Vane has a map etched on a fishbone, but refuses to sell it.
- Something is whispering through the eels in the bar tank…

## Secrets & Hidden Information
- The cellar opens into an old smuggler tunnel sealed for years.
- Salttooth Vane once sailed with Bloodshot and knows more than he lets on.
- The stew’s secret ingredient may be alchemically active—an accident or a weapon?
