# Chase Gun Condos

## Overview
A lavish multi-tiered residential block built from the refurbished husk of an old artillery barracks, Chase Gun Condos caters to captains, quartermasters, and high-ranking crew members who want a foothold in Black Brine without giving up the comforts of high-seas spoils. The name is a nod to the ship-mounted cannons once stored here—some of which now serve as extravagant decorative pieces in the courtyards.

## Geography
Located just uphill from the Salt Crown marketplace, the Condos offer commanding views of the harbor. Balconies face the sea breeze, and private rooftop gardens are common. The structure is fortified with reinforced timber and stone, a reminder of its military origins.

## Notable Features
- Private guard and doorman (usually a retired bosun named Crank)
- Rooftop watch deck, often used for scouting fleet arrivals
- Shared courtyard with old naval statues and a functioning well
- Cannon-turned-fountain centerpiece in the garden plaza

## Demographics
Home to successful pirates, retired smugglers, and wealthy merchants allied to the pirate fleets. Most residents have connections to the Captains’ Council or their quartermasters.

## Economy
Extremely expensive to rent or purchase. Units are paid for in gold, favor, or exclusive trade agreements. Bribes to skip the waiting list are standard practice.

## Culture & Daily Life
Residents compete quietly for prestige—lavish decor, exotic pets, imported food. Dueling is strictly banned on the premises, but whispered deals and affairs are common. Gossip travels fast, especially from balconies overheard.

## Secrets & Hidden Information
There’s said to be a hidden panic room in one of the oldest units, built into a secret tunnel from the barracks era. Some say the steward, Crank, keeps records of everyone’s comings and goings—whether for security or blackmail is unclear.

## Adventure Hooks
- A high-profile resident is missing, and their apartment is locked from the inside
- A priceless heirloom was stolen during a rooftop gala
- A cursed cannon used in the plaza’s fountain begins firing spectral rounds at midnight

## Connected Locations
- Rita’s Smithy (many residents order custom armor or weapon racks)
- Lending House of Black Brine (finances unit purchases)
- Velvet Nest (where many of the condo’s wealthier residents indulge in secrets)
