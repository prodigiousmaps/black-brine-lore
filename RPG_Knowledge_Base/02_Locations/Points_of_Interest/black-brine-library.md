# Overview
A converted chapel turned into a public library and meeting hall. The Library is one of the few places in Blackmire where learning, gossip, and records are freely exchanged. Its shelves mix genuine tomes with forgeries and cursed scrolls.  

# Notable Features
- Lecterns scarred with old prayers.  
- Shelves crammed with damp books and sailor’s journals.  
- Alcoves where secret societies gather by night.  

# Adventure Hooks
- A forbidden tome on Sedna’s cult surfaces among the stacks.  
- A missing scribe vanished into Foghouse Row tunnels.  
- The Council seeks PCs to recover lost ledgers stolen from the library.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Beneath the library is a sealed reliquary chamber.  
- Its curators are informants for multiple factions — including the Butchers.
