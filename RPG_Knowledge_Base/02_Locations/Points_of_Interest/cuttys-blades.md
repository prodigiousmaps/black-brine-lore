# Cutty’s Blades

## Overview
A lavish, high-walled structure nestled in the winding alleys of Mistwalk, **Cutty’s Blades** is known as the finest purveyor of dueling weapons in Black Brine—and secretly serves as the headquarters for the **Widowmakers**, the island’s most feared fleet of assassins. The shop is as much a shrine to the blade as it is a front for cold, quiet murder.

## Appearance
Stone-faced and tightly kept, the shop glimmers with wealth. Stained glass windows display images of legendary duels. Polished iron sconces burn smokeless candles. Inside, it’s all gleaming weapon racks, velvet displays, and a training floor tiled in imported obsidian. A spiral staircase leads to the upper chambers, where very few are welcome.

## Layout
- **Ground Floor**: Retail gallery of mastercrafted swords, daggers, and rapiers. Custom orders only. Dueling memorabilia and portraits of historic swordmasters line the walls.
- **Training Hall**: Rear courtyard equipped with sand pits, striking dummies, and hidden observation balconies.
- **Upper Quarters**: Secret meeting rooms, Widowmaker war table, and private lodgings for the fleet’s Captain and lieutenants.

## Notable Features
- **Practice Grounds**: Open-air yard where the elite duel under silence spells. Fencing masks, bloodstained sashes, and antique blades abound.
- **Widowmaker Vault**: A locked room containing trophies from successful assassinations and dossiers on future marks.
- **Legacy Wall**: Massive mural of stylized Widowmaker victories—each dagger painted with real blood from a first kill.

## Regulars & Staff
- **Captain Sera "Cutty" Vex** – Master duelist and cold-eyed leader of the Widowmakers. Her smile is a lie.
- **Jhenna** – Quiet shop steward and armorer, missing two fingers.
