# Overview
Once a thriving street of smuggler dens and boarding houses, Foghouse Row has collapsed into ruin. The air is thick with mist, the wood perpetually damp, and shadows shift unnaturally. Locals avoid the area, claiming it swallows the unwary.  

# Notable Features
- Rotting timbers lean across narrow alleys.  
- Submerged basements hide forgotten caches.  
- Tunnels connect to Miremarket and the Crooked Lantern.  

# Adventure Hooks
- Vanishings in Blackmire trace back to Foghouse Row.  
- A rival crew claims to have found an “unopened” smuggler vault.  
- Strange lights flicker at night; investigation reveals otherworldly activity.  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- Tunnels open into cult chambers tied to Sedna’s chained power.  
- Creatures from the mire nest here, feeding on fear and dreams.
