# Overview
The western half of Sedna is a cursed jungle, avoided by all who dwell in Black Brine. The land is hostile and resists intrusion. Voices whisper from the mist, and expedition parties vanish without trace.

# Geography
- Dense jungle canopy and flooded gullies.  
- Crumbled shrines to Sedna and other ancient gods.  
- Entrances to hidden cave networks.  

# Notable Features
- **Jungle Ruins**: Moss-choked altars and temples where Sedna’s power lingers.  
- **Shrines**: Portals or foci for Sedna’s magic.  
- **Haunted Trails**: Paths that loop endlessly, leading explorers in circles.  

# Adventure Hooks
- A pirate lord pays handsomely for relics retrieved from the ruins.  
- A haunting voice calls to Sy, Franklin, or Pinch in their dreams.  
- A rival expedition is already inside the jungle—can the PCs catch them?  

# Secrets (DM Only)
- The Lost Keepers, once priests of Sedna, roam as twisted guardians.  
- Jungle shrines mask planar gates to sea, shadow, and memory.  
- The Forbidden West feeds on explorers’ fear, shaping illusions and dangers.
