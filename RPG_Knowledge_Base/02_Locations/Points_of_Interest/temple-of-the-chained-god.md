# Temple of the Chained God

## Overview
A looming edifice at the heart of Gallows Market, the Temple of the Chained God is the spiritual and political front of a mainland religion making fast inroads into Black Brine. Towering over the cobbled plaza, the temple blends radiant beauty with a sinister undercurrent—its message of salvation spread through honeyed sermons, charitable deeds, and quiet coercion.

## Architecture & Appearance
- Vast marble and iron structure with spiked buttresses and a domed roof of burnished brass.
- A **colossal chained statue** dominates the facade—arms spread, dragging the world’s suffering behind him in massive iron links.
- Inside, **incense and stained glass** bathe the interior in soft golds and reds, hiding grim murals beneath the surface.
- Courtyards bustle with veterans, the poor, and newly sworn converts.
- Upper chambers are restricted and contain **ritual archives**, **whispering cells**, and the **Chamber of Binding**—a place few return from.

## Religion & Symbolism

### Imagery
- The god is portrayed as a selfless redeemer dragging mortal suffering up a slope toward salvation, bound by divine chains.
- Symbols include lanterns, chains, the open palm, and the iron tear.

### Tenets
- **Redemption through Sacrifice** – pain is the path to purification.
- **Suffering is Holy** – your chains are your blessing.
- **The Chain is the Light** – submission binds us to grace.

## Role in Black Brine Society

### Influence
- Rapidly spreading through **charity**, **shelters**, and **healing services**.
- **Feeds and houses retired pirates and veterans**, giving them purpose—while indoctrinating them into the fold.
- A **source of mounting tension**, particularly among traditionalists and worshipers of Sedna.

### Political Tensions
- **Gun Deck Rosy** despises the temple’s influence but cannot act directly without inflaming civil unrest.
- **Nobles** resent the influx of the “unwashed” into Mistwalk’s heart, even as the church calls for “one people, one pain, one path.”

## Secrets & Hidden Information (DM Only)

- The god’s origins are not divine, but an **exiled celestial** bound in chains for attempting to rewrite the laws of mortality.
- The **Chamber of Binding** is a place of ritual transformation—some leave better, most leave broken.
- A secret order within the church, the **Iron Lantern**, is tasked with identifying “unworthy” souls for public execution or private reconditioning.
