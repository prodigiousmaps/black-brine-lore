# Black Brine YAML Standard v1 (human-readable guide)
# --------------------------------------------------
# This file describes required/optional fields per type and the relationship
# fields the tooling understands. Keep front-matter in YAML between --- blocks.
#
# General rules
# - Every file should have: type, id, name, summary
# - id format: bb:<type>:<slug>  (lowercase, hyphens)
# - names used in other files should be added to aliases/aliases.yaml once
# - relationship fields accept either canonical ids or human names; names are
#   resolved via aliases+fuzzy matching during enrichment
#
# Shared fields (any type)
#   type: npc | faction | organization | location | district | city | item | story | event | page
#   id:   bb:<type>:<slug>
#   name: "Readable Name"
#   summary: >
#     One or two sentences that capture essence.
#   aliases: [ "Alt Name A", "Alt Name B" ]   # optional
