The deep altars lay dry. The temples opened to air, and incense climbed where blood once fell.\n\nThey called her the Shaper of the High Current,\n\nThe Sky-Blessed Flame,\n\nThe One Who Sings Without Chains.\n\nBut the Deep Mother does not forget. The Taker of Breath, She Who Waits Below‚Äî\n\nShe stirred in the silence left behind.\n\nIn a single tide without wave, the silence took shape. The sky was split. The earth wept salt.\n\nHer vengeance fell not in rage, but in erasure.‚Ä¶",
