Sedna shares a domain with Prince Sashelas, and is occasionally allied with him. Sedna was once a beautiful goddess of druids who walked along the land. Her father, the wild god Malar, desired a pact with the Dark Lords of the Depths, and promised Sedna’s hand to the the Void of the Sea. When Sedna clung to his canoe to save herself from the depths, Malar bit off her fingers. In the dark depths, Sedna became the unwilling Bride of the Void, and learned many dark rituals that cannot be spoken in the light of day. Using these dark rituals, Sedna betrayed her husband, and sealed his monstrous body within his palace, behind a barrier of blood magic. …",

The deep altars lay dry. The temples opened to air, and incense climbed where blood once fell.\n\nThey called her the Shaper of the High Current,\n\nThe Sky-Blessed Flame,\n\nThe One Who Sings Without Chains.\n\nBut the Deep Mother does not forget. The Taker of Breath, She Who Waits Below—\n\nShe stirred in the silence left behind.\n\nIn a single tide without wave, the silence took shape. The sky was split. The earth wept salt.\n\nHer vengeance fell not in rage, but in erasure.…",
